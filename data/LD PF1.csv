1,"A very minor thing happened which triggered my panic attack. I made a very small mistake at a center I visited which led to me spiraling down into anxiety and depression because I thought ""if i cannot even get this thing right, how am I even gonna find and hold down a job""? I previously burnout hard at my masters, and subsequently dropped out, developed health issues, and my future isnt certain and I am very anxious about it. 

I locked myself up in my room all day because I am having suicidal thoughts. I told my mom what happened, and continued to lock myself up. 

During dinner time, I heard noises. Turns out my parents were fighting about what I told my mom, and then my dad said ""a loser is a loser""; I am sure he is referring to me.

And the side effects have been undesirable. I also have severe health anxiety which affects my day to day living. I am fortunate to have adult children who understand but very few others do. My husband just thinks I'm lazy and finds my problems very annoying. I have had 3 major episodes in my life. The rest of the time it is there but bearable for the most part.

They're a big part of who I am and they're essentially topics I could talk about for hours given that I'm talking with someone open minded that respects my tastes.

However, when I do get asked by others about what I like I just freeze and send them off with a generic answer like ""Oh, I just don't watch/listen/care about x thing to have a favorite, sorry""

And that's just completely untrue and it pains me that I can't have a proper discussion with anyone about what I like without having them judge me for my passions.

1,"Have you ever been triggered just before bed? Not a pleasant experience in any way, shape, or form.

I [19M] need advice on how to deal with being a failure. 

In my life I have not accomplished a single thing which I have strived for. I’ve wanted to be a musician my whole life and my 20tg birthday is only days away now. I have suffered from anxiety my entire life but it lessened when I picked up the guitar and started recording my own music. That was 5 years ago. Now it’s dawning on me that definitely nothing will come from my ambition. All of my friends have stable relationships and a clear path to whatever it is they want to pursue in life. I recently broke up with my girlfriend because I didn’t think I was ready for a relationship. Since then it’s been meaningless sex with people I barely know and falling victim to becoming easily attached to everyone and anything, which makes me think I probably made a mistake and I’m never going to get her back. My career is going nowhere as I see people younger than me already being signed to record labels and making a living off of their music.

Nothing seems to be worth it anymore. I’ve lost all and any appetite and have lost a lot of weight. It feels like I constantly have an itch in my stomach and I’m always worried about everything. I’m slowly turning to alcohol for comfort because it does wonders to any negative feelings I have. None of this probably makes any sense at all.

Even going on Instagram, I’m met with articles and articles about something in the news. It’s gotten as far as effecting my relationship with my family, because of this non-stop anxiety. They don’t know what to do. And neither do I, because on one hand, I want to know what’s happening in the world, but on the other my mental health gets worse if I listen to it.

even if I don’t feel anxious for a second I’m reminded of “that thing” that always looms over me and is waiting to destroy my life. everything reminds me of the reason im anxious and nothing makes the feeling go away.

feels like ever even trying to get better is pointless because the reason im anxious doesn’t feel irrational at all to me, like oh actually YOU SHOULD BE ANXIOUS, you deserve it and it makes sense because it IS GONNA HAPPEN. And if someone tries to console me I just think that I don’t deserve it and if they understood why I was worried they wouldn’t feel any sympathy for me.

i just feel so lost and like my life is pointless because I’m waiting for it all to come crashing down...

if anyone has any experience for a similar situation and it got better, I’d be glad to hear it :)",Anxiety,I’m so tired of living this way... i never feel fine anymore,Personality,

1,"Hi everyone,

I have had this phobia of fainting from dehydration when I am outside. I usually carry a bottle of water wherever I go. Sometimes when I forget to take it, I get panicky and tend to want to buy a bottle of water immediately or go back home.

I want to know scientifically under what circumstances one can get dehydrated to point of feeling dizzy. I know it depends on a lot of things like how hot it is, what activity we are doing, body type. But I just want to know if anyone is aware of any medical articles which shed some light on it for a normal physically healthy person.

A large part of my exposure therapy is to reaffirm to myself that I drank water x minutes ago so I should be fine and any thoughts of panic are irrational. So I need to read some literature on this.

As an analogy, I used to feel afraid that I might faint due to an elevated heart rate, but science tells me that an elevated heart rate increases blood pressure and so it's unlikely one would faint (as fainting requires a sudden drop in heart rate). Knowing this helps me a lot during exposure therapy.

Thank you",Anxiety,how soon do we get dehydrated?,Personality,

I got a chicken sandwich from culver's it was delicious, and I layed in my car in the culver's parking lot and felt good for minute but knew as soon as I left I would freak out again, so I left and I pretty much did.

1,"I am out of words. I never thought i would overcome that stage of my life. I was suffering from depression and low self esteem since childhood and  due to lockdown and whole covid situation, i developed severe anxiety too. 

It starts with me waking up and I felt calm when I slept. Those depressing and hurtful thoughts were always in position waiting for me to wake up and hurt me. My heart used to beat hard, it used to pain. I had to lie down to make it slow down. It got so bad that sometimes thoughts of suicide seemed good. I always had this love for life. I knew life exists beyond my room but no job, many fears specially the fear of ""what others will think"" crippled me. But this love for life which was there deep inside my heart made me reject those suicidal thoughts. So, two and half months back, i finally decided to do something about it. 

I started doing meditation, cut down most of the social media except reddit, started focusing on why i  am having these thoughts? Meditation is the most powerful tool available to us and it changed me completely. It was really hard initially to just focus on your breath with all these thoughts attacking you continuously and i couldn't do it for more than 5 mins. But persistance was the game changer. Slowly,  my meditating time grew from 5 to 10 to 15 min and after a month, i was able to sit for 30 mins. I became mindful of my thoughts and my anxiety and depression started lowering. 

Thoughts can only harm if you let them. If you start ignoring them, their power on you start reducing and eventually they stop coming to you.  When you start focusing on yourself, the thoughts of "" what others will think"" don't matter much to you. 

Meditation helped me in ignoring bad thoughts and to explore what's deep in me, the Real me! I knew the power of crystals and bought an Om crystal necklace when i decided to change myself. I started wearing it daily and often do the meditation chanting  ""OM""( which is a really powerful word) and i believe my crystal necklace helped attracting positivity in me(maybe placebo, i don't know! But it helped) . My meditation sessions are so deep when i chant this word. 

Today, I woke up pretty happy. I am feeling this appreciation and gratitude for life. So, i decided to write this post if it can help anyone. My English is not that Good so pardon me for any mistake and for this long post too! 

Love and Power to all of you!  You will overcome this too, just keep fighting 👍",Anxiety,The Horrible Suffering is Finally Gone!,Personality,

1,"Hello redditors,

Lately, I've been feeling guilty everytime I spend money on myself.  I spend maybe 10% of my paycheck on myself each week, and am living fairly comfortably for a 20 year old.  I know I'm not in a hard place relatively, but looking for advice on guilt I feel with spending money on myself or doing anything that involves putting myself first.

I work 55 hours a week (12pm-11:30pm), so I logically know I should be able to reward myself on occasion, but I don't feel I ""deserve"" it.  Most people are excited to get things for themselves, but I sort of fall into a dark hole when I do.

There seems to be nothing ""right"" with severe anxiety.  If I don't treat myself, I get anxious about turning into a worker robot who lives to work and works to live.  If I treat myself, I feel like I'm undeserving and selfish.

I think a lot of it has to do with having a very fortunate childhood, and then I reached adulthood and starting mentally calculating the money my parents spent on me, and I feel like I need to pay them back somehow.

1,"At my last doctors appt I finally grew the balls to actually tell my doctor that I’m depressed, this was about two months ago. I’m a minor, so I have to do the little mental health surveys and admittedly, I usually put down that I’m A-OK, while that isn’t the case. And although I did say on the analysis that I’m feeling depressed, I still lied about my suicidal thoughts and how little I take care of myself. And since I lied about it my doctor just told my mother that I’m “feeling a little depressed due to the pandemic and all that” Which is definitely the understatement of the year, but again, I’m to blame for that. Despite wanting to tell my friends and family about this, I still just can’t bring myself to do it. I’m definitely not telling my doctor anytime soon, I just get way too anxious and I don’t have it in me to have a panic attack at my doctors office. I do want help, which is why I’m typing this, but I don’t know how to bring myself to actually do it. Frankly, I’m pretty embarrassed about it, and my mom definitely can’t afford to pay for a therapist and any more medications than she already does. I don’t even know if my mom will take me seriously if I do end up telling her. Even if she was only told that I’m only “a little bit depressed”, I think it’s quite obvious that it’s more than that, I lay in bed for days at a time soaking in my own filth.

1,"I've always been an anxious person so I'm obviously overthinking this but my main concern is that everyone seems to be talking about being constantly exhausted and finding it hard to get out of bed and that just. Never happens to me? I have no problems with hygiene or keeping the house clean, I do procrastinate tasks that I find distressing until the last minute but I still get them done and I've always done that. I do feel unmotivated most of the time but I do fine at both work and school. 

I noticed that I don't really do things for fun anymore and my mood is obviously not good, it changes between sadness, nothing and ""meh"", my thoughts and perception of myself and the world are so distorted that even I can sometimes see how they make no sense and I do feel like I want to erase myself from existence because that'd be easier than putting in the work to get my shit together, I just don't do it because I know that'd be shitty for the people who know me. Like I know they care about me but I can't understand why when I'm actually worthless.

Can't judge my eating and sleeping patterns too well, I'd say they're fine but my friend says I'm just being dumb because my reasoning is that I sleep through more nights than the ones where I wake up at 2am or can't sleep at all...That happens but not often enough for me to consider it a problem.

In the last few days I can't concentrate and forget just about everything that happens during the day, I have a hard time recalling what I've done even when I know I've been really doing things. I find that part kind of scary. 

But my issue with all of this is that I don't think it's constant or been going on long enough for an actual diagnoses? I guess I'm scared that I go there and get told that there's nothing wrong with me and then I'll have to somehow just solve this on my own. I'm seeing a psychologist usually but we're on a holiday break for a few weeks and all of this has escalated only in recent days, so the last time we talked I didn't bring it up. I'm seeing her for autogenic training so the sessions have a pretty much fixed schedule and sometimes I think it helped already with my anxiety and in making an conscious effort to not isolate myself from my friends, but when I have to practice on my own it just falls apart and it feels like I got anxiety swapped for depression. I don't know how to put in the work to help myself and I guess that's the real problem here. I know I need therapy because even if I get out on meds or something my issues won't just magically go away but I don't think I can be proactive enough to go after the help I need, if that makes sense.

I'm 23 years (i know im very young but the thought of even another year is pretty unbearable) old currently going through a divorce from my wife of 4 years and a relationship of 5 years met in highschool and the relationship was awful, co-dependent, toxic, and suffocating. I have finally accepted that it was necessary to end after a couple months of debilitating depression and suicidal thoughts now, but I'm back to square 1. I have been depressed for about as long as i can remember maybe young teens ( i grew up religious so that wasn't really an option to be depressed). The biggest issue i face and have on a daily basis is i dont give a fuck about anything that actually requires effort. I have a couple friends that mean a lot to me and family that is supportive and love me but you cant just talk to loved ones about being depressed and how life is pointless 24/7. I go to college online because i was in the Navy and got out because that really drove my depression through the roof so school felt like the reasonable thing to do. Honestly though i wouldn't care if someone came and gave me the degree right now to do the job i am studying for because what is going to be different? ill have money? sure i guess maybe even meet someone new? yeah well then what. 

It all just seems like life is a fucking game where we can see who can convince themselves that what they are doing is important and i just cant. I cant convince myself that that's worth anything or distract myself long enough to get through this. I guess the only thing that keeps me going is a little sliver of hope that maybe one day ill find ""it"" or just stop thinking so fucking much and analyzing about what the purpose or meaning of everything is.

I think I have realized that my main motivation or deterrent from completely giving up or suicided is this weird idea of how much can I actually take before it will truly all just snap. So the longer i live the more opportunity for suffering and pain and it almost seems like that's my purpose is to just endure life for just the sake of enduring.

1,"Just a very long rambling from a waste of space.  I don’t talk to anyone about this stuff, so I figured I could just vent online. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

It’s currently winter break for me, but it’ll end in a few days. I’ve done absolutely nothing these past few weeks, but I didn’t think anything of it until now. I had a great time calling friends everyday, playing games with them, etc, and I was really happy. I genuinely was. The last time I felt like this was a month ago; it was so nice, not feeling like a worthless waste of space.

I have a brother who is a super genius. He has won multiple prestigious awards for mathematics and physics, has flawless grades without studying, writes research papers, develops apps, and has endless career opportunities. My friends all know him because he went to my high school; he’s essentially a legend. And yet here I am. A worthless piece of shit. 

My grades are terrible, my work ethic is non-existent, I have no passions, I can’t force myself to do anything, I suck at socializing, I’m butt ugly, I understand nothing at school, and I’m a failure compared to my brother—or anyone, really. I’m irresponsible and can’t do anything by myself. My dad kept nagging me to do SAT practice this entire break, and I didn’t touch the book once. The PSAT I took last year I got a 1320 while every one of my friends and classmates that I know got well above a 1500. This doesn’t even matter. Idk why Im talking about this.

In general, I just feel... worthless. I feel like I’m wasting other people’s time. I feel like my brother deserves a much better sister than me. He’s better off without me. I’m imagining how, in the future, he’ll be famous for some discovery or invention, and I’ll taint his name when news headlines say his sister is dying and homeless. He’s so kind to me, too. He answers questions when I’m confused (he knows literally everything) and he makes me laugh. I don’t deserve him. I should be dead. I shouldn’t be allowed to have him. He shouldn’t deserve to have a sister like me.

My friends, too. I don’t deserve them. One of them bought me a drawing tablet for me to use instead of my phone. What did I do to deserve it? Whenever I see it, I feel guilty that she didn’t give it to someone else. When I talk to my parents, I feel guilty that they had to have a child like me. 

And the ironic thing about all of this is that, I keep saying everything would be better without me, but here I am. I’m too scared to do anything. I tell myself to disappear, yet I want to keep living. I’m afraid of death, yet I want to embrace it. I don’t know what I’m doing with my life. I don’t know what to study in college, what career I want, what my type is for a partner, what my hobbies are—I’m just so lost. My friends all have a career in their mind and a list of colleges to apply to. I have nothing. I don’t even have a clue. I just want to disappear but keep living at the same time. I hate myself. I hate how I can even do the littlest things right. 

Im just waiting for someone to kill me since I can’t do it myself. I just have to keep living like this until someone can kindly end me. I want to enjoy life, but it’s really hard when you’re a piece of shit like me.

I don’t know why I’m writing a whole fucking essay on reddit. I’m just lost. I just want to rant. I don’t expect anyone to read this. I just want to tell someone or put it out there.

I'm actually crying a bit writing this, but it's good tears...I bloody made it. I'm still here, and I believe I'm out of the worst of it.

I don’t have the internship lined up and I’m extremely nervous about my last 3 classes. For some dumb reason I’ve saved the three hardest classes for last and I am taking a break winter quarter because this last fall quarter I thought about killing myself more seriously than I ever have before. I don’t think the break is necessarily wrong, but part of me thinks I’m just stalling. I’ve stacked the pressure on myself for this coming spring quarter.

The internship is stressing me out too. I don’t have anything lined up and I feel like I’m running out of time. Everywhere I’ve looked required a gpa of 3.0 or higher and my grades just aren’t there so I’ve never applied. I don’t have anything resembling an impressive accomplish to put on a resume or in a cover letter. I’ve worked part time at a car wash for the past two years and I have no experience in Cyber Security much less IT in general. 

I feel so fucking stupid, I don’t know anything that’s going on in my classes and my self care has tanked so bad this past year. I never really even wanted to go to college or study IT. I was pressured to go by my parents and I picked IT cause I spend most of my time playing video games or wasting time on my computer and I figured it seemed easy, but I really have no interest or idea at all about cyber security or IT or any of the complicated stuff. I didn’t really think it was gonna be hard at all, but I just have no drive to try. I want to quit and I want to die but I’m so close I feel like I’m letting down every single person in my life.

The latest incident - he asked me if I was ok going to a NYE party with around 50 people, though I’m nervous about it I said I’m ok with it. He made plans with his friend. Later on I got anxious and told him I’m nervous and he warns me I need to have a good time tomorrow night if we go, but we can cancel if I want. I said no I’m ok. An hour later my anxiety got so bad and I started crying, he asked me sweetly if I’m ok, I said no, he asked do you want me to cancel, I said yes ....

He started screaming a little. Hit the couch. I get it.  He’s frustrated because I just took it away from him, this chance to have fun finally without masks or restrictions, and I also fucked him over with his friend by making him cancel after he’s already made plans. I made his reputation look like shit and fucked him over. he says I’m mentally fucked and I deserve him yelling at me. That I’m mentally and morally broken. 

I hate myself why couldn’t I just have told him before he made the plans???

Basically, the other day I told fellow depression sufferer that although there are many things I enjoy about life, such as the food, the laughter, the video games and Christmas and good movies and all that, I wouldn’t choose to do it over again.

1,"""Dear Mom,

I do not expect you to understand the contents of this letter. After all, you didn’t really understand much at all in my life. I doubt you truly understood anything. 

Writing this letter, I wonder if you had not held me back in kindergarten, how would my life be different? 

I wished I had cousins that not only related to and had things in common, but were actually in similar life stages to me.

I wonder if I had my first kiss in high school or even kissed a girl at all. I wonder if I had gotten my drivers’ license at 17. Not trying to get one at the embarrassing age of 25. I wonder if I actually lost my virginity before I graduated from college like a normal person. I wonder if my life would have been allowed to be done so on time like everyone else. 

If I had worked hard enough in high school, got a scholarship to a top college would you have approved my wanting to be independent then? Did you realize that what I really wanted at the end was the “college experience”, which was in fact me saying I just wanted the adolescence I missed out on. 

If I had a normal college experience, I think I would have been more accepting of adulthood. The tedious 9 to 5 job. The inevitable cliched marriage. The stupid and petulant children. Your friends painfully disappearing at 30 because they are off getting married. I would have tolerated it. All of it. 

I wonder if my life wasn’t so sheltered and so coddled. 

Yes. With a heavy heart. I am sad I had to do what I did. The thing is though, I was 25 years old and so behind everyone in everything. 

You must understand. Finding friends is harder at 25. Sure, I could have maybe made friends. But being 25, 27, or 29, they weren’t gonna come out the woodwork as they would have at 17, 18, or 19. 

Plus, I wanted to make up for my lost adolescence. No 25 year old is interested in partying like in their college days. I also had doubts I would have been close to these adult friends. Friendships in your growth years like childhood, teenage years, and college years are important for a reason. Again, 25 is different than 19. They simply would have never been good enough to me.

In truth Mom, I hated being the favorite. I wish I was my older brother. Why did you love me so much? I knew you loved me, but it was so suffocating. Truth be told, all I wished was that you would go away. I absolutely hated that I was gonna be a late bloomer. 

In the end Mom, it wasn’t your fault. I should have known you were going to put up that big of an opposition. I should have as I said before, worked harder in high school and should have known college was going to be that expensive. I should have done much more to prove that I could have been independent. I should have put myself out there more. 

You must be asking why can’t you learn now? Yes. That is true. The social life I am looking for however, is not really possible at 25. Mom, the nature of relationships is just different at my biological age. You have to realize I am at an age that people begin to start getting married or have serious relationships. People have either less time or actually no time at all to have fun. Yes. I desperately want to be an adolescent again but that wasn’t going to happen. 

Mom. I need you to know. You have a son that has done everything right and on time. Stop your coddling of me and look at what has been in front of you this whole time. The perfect son has been there and for once in your life, acknowledge him. I must ask, why the fuck am I the favorite?

In the end, it doesn’t matter now. I am gone and hopefully at peace. Don’t feel bad for me. My life truly had nothing to show for it. Hopefully, the anguish is gone.

Have a peaceful rest of your life,

1,"I suffer from dissociative identity disorder, no one will probably see this and all this may be confusing but I needed to vent. Backstory: I started dating someone I really liked but it ended because my alter hooked up with his friend. 

When I look back at what I can remember from experiences from my alter I feel so shocked and scared. I can’t believe I did those things. I can’t believe I gave oral sex to a complete stranger. This was someone I knew nothing about but their name. I feel angry that this person used my alter and essentially me, my body. I feel disgusted that this person wanted sex in exchange for a drug. I can remember the taste of the cocaine in my throat as I write this. I can remember the feeling of the cocaine going up my nose as I write this. I can’t process that this was me, my body. I can’t process the events because this was something my alter did. I am just in shock and cannot even process it. I can’t think about the emotions during the moment because there were no emotions. I feel like any emotions felt would have made this easier to process but it just feels like a movie. Like I saw this all happen through a lens of movie screen. The only thing helping me ground myself in this experience is the physical feeling of doing the cocaine, which is really the only thing I felt. I remember standing outside of a hotel with him. He was looking for open hotels to go to. I was standing near him as he looked through his phone. I was not saying anything, instead looking around like some sort of virtual reality game. I am scared because I remember him looking up at me and aggressively asking me why I am so awkward. Then he asked me why I was backing up. What scares me is that I did not know I was backing up. My body was numb. I had no idea and still have no recollection of myself backing up. I could not respond. This time my alter was speechless. This was different from my first experience, or the first experience I can remember of my alter coming out. It was the fourth of July and I had arrived to a party at his house. At one point I remember looking around the room while the guy I was dating was talking to me. I can’t remember what he was talking about but I remember looking around the room and feeling a bit of fear because the surroundings and events reminded me of the first time I got alcohol poisoning. The room with a couch is what reminded me of that night. Sometime after that moment I felt a switch in my eyes and my alter took over. I feel shocked that someone could just lose complete control of their body, words, brain. I remember following his friend around. Somehow I followed him outside. I have no idea where the guy I was dating was throughout most of this ordeal. I can’t really remember what I was talking about but I know I was talking at the speed of light. I have little to no recollection of what my alter said but I know it was abnormal, strange, inappropriate. From the expressions I can remember he seemed to have a mix of confusion and shock. Apparently I kept asking him to give me a tour of his house, I would not stop. Then it became a tour of his room. I was aggressively coming onto him and wanted to have sex with him. Sex with a complete stranger. All I knew about him was that he did something in finance, used cocaine, smoked cigarettes, drank, and lived in this house. This is someone who I would not at all look at. I do not really have an attraction to men for their appearance. It takes me a while to develop an attraction as my attraction is all about personality. It has little to nothing to do with looks, which is the last thing I think about. I remember very little from that night but feel extreme embarrassment and shame from what I can remember. Aside from doing everything to try to have sex with this man I remember standing outside with him and the guy I was dating. The guy I was dating was trying to impress me. I remember being shocked that he did not have a robinhood account. To which he insisted he did, an obvious lie to try to save face and keep me impressed or something. Why would I shame someone for not having a robinhood account? That embarrasses me. The most embarrassing part of the night is something I can barely remember. I have never felt so much embarrassment in my life. His friend has kissed me in a room while the guy I was dating had left the room for whatever reason. I think the guy I was dating confronted me about the way I was coming onto his friend or flirting with him because I remember aggressively insisting that his friend would never do anything to upset him. That his friend did not try anything with me and refused to even give me a tour of his house. I insisted that my request for his friend to give me a tour of his house was innocent. An innocent request which my alter knew was not true. The entire conversation was a lie. I was very loud and reassuring about my lack of interest in his friend and his friend’s faithfulness to their friendship. I kept saying his friend would never and used the fact that his friend refused to even give me a tour of his house as some type of leverage. This part embarrasses me the most. Because he now knows those were all lies. This only makes my alter seem crazier, more manipulative, and deceitful. My desperate attempts to save face and my obvious and loud lies are what embarrass me the most. Us being so close against my car. The memory haunts me. I can’t stop feeling embarrassed. I replay that night in my mind consistently. I replay what I can remember, which is very little but beyond shocking, embarrassing, and terrifying. Its terrifying how I could lose complete control over my mind and body. I am so embarrassed and ashamed of the actions of my alter. My alter represents me. Now that I am back in my main personality I have to deal with the emotions that come with the actions of my alter. It’s like watching a video. I can’t remember executing any of those actions myself. It was like a movie screen. Like being a passenger in my own body. There is nothing I can do to redeem myself. It was all so extreme. These are things I would never do. I am so embarrassed and ashamed from my alter coming onto his friend- something she did so strongly. But what embarrasses me the most is denying those very blatant and strong attempts to sleep with his friend. Reassuring him so strongly that his friend would never accept such a request and was such a faithful friend for not even accepting to give me a tour of his house. I am so angry at my alter. I am beyond furious with my alter. Furious for representing me in such a way, furious for the embarrassment and shame she brought me. Furious about the impact she had on my life. I really liked this guy. There is nothing I can do to save myself from what my alter did. I am not angry at myself for losing control of my body because it was beyond out of my control. It was like being possessed. Possessed by a demonic jezebel. The best way I can describe this is truly as a possession. You can’t be angry at yourself for getting possessed because it’s out of your control but you can be angry, embarrassed, and ashamed by the actions and words emitted from your body from the possession. I am trying so hard to be nice to myself but I can’t get over that night or the subsequent events. I can’t get over the way the guy I was dating called me the most deranged and psychotic person he has ever met because its true. I never knew the impact my childhood would have on me. But why now? Why did it have to be when I found someone I really liked? Why did she have to embarrass me so strongly? Why is she so hypersexual, deceitful, aggressive, manipulative, and sadistic? Understanding, compassion, and awareness will not serve me. It will not reverse my actions, my representation. I have to accept what my alter did and how she represented me. I have to accept that these people think I am my alter. That my alter is my main and only personality. I have a strong hatred for my alter. We went through the exact same events. Why is she like this and why did she have to come out now? Why did she have to come out with those people? With the guy I was dating? Why years later? I keep trying to tell myself that I went through a lot but I don’t see it that way and have never seen it that way. I have always swept those events and occurrences under the rug. I never allowed them to affect my behavior or demeanor, especially around others. I am so careful with my actions, words, and behavior around others. Too careful. I never want to say the “wrong’ thing. My biggest fear is to upset someone. I can’t accept that I went through a lot because people go through worse and don’t turn out this way. I should be able to accept it and leave it in the past. I should be able to be mentally healthy at all times. I should be in control of my brain. How could something so much like a possession happen in my own body? How does one lose so much control in one second? I try to tell myself I went through a lot but still can’t. It wasn’t until I got to college and spent a prolonged amount of time with others my age that I first realized that I was different. Very different. I was not able to socialize in the way others did. I was not able to function with the ease that others could. I was not able to control my substance use. I became so addicted. This was not the case for anyone else. Nobody else had used so many substances. No one else was addicted. I had to do so much more than others to get through a single day. I tried to kill myself with drugs and alcohol. I tried to kill the memories. I tried to kill all of my memories from birth. Being molested by around 10 people from the age of 4 or 5. The beatings. What affected me the most was the sexual abuse. I wanted to forget it all or die trying. I wanted those memories gone because if they were gone I could move on with my life and life a happy healthy life. I could not accept the memories. I am so detached from the memories. They happened, I can remember. But I can’t process that it was me. It was me. This happened to me. I can’t accept this. That wasn’t me, it couldn’t happen to me. I have been thinking more about the memories although I still haven’t been able to process them or accept them. But I am trying to connect the dots between those events and my alter. I need an explanation for my alter. But the explanation is not an excuse. I am so angry with my alter. I try to tell myself that I was groomed. I was not only forced to engage in sex acts but was forced to act as if I wanted it. I was trained to instigate these sexual situations and participate in ways that were not physical. I was taught to role play, to come onto others, to behave in a manner that was hypersexual. To act like I wanted it, to act like an adult in a porn movie. I was probably around 7 when this particular girl started to implement sex acts into games. It started as a friendship, she was mean but I hung out with her. I was lonely. She progressively would try to implement these sexual games into our hang outs. I was reluctant for such a long time. I refused. Somewhere along the way she started to teach me these sex acts. Then would try to teach me and convince me to act like adults do in porn movies. The funny thing is I have never watched a porn movie but can tell from the media that this is the way porn stars act in movies. They act as nurses, doctors, and play out sexual situations in settings where this is not appropriate. She made me act like we were in a relationship, she made me role play. She trained me to want to engage in the sex acts and “act”  out different roles. She made me give her oral sex, she would put her fingers up my behind. I couldn’t have been more than 8 years old. This was only one of the few people that molested me. The molestations lasted years. Each person molesting me for a different amount of instances. I can’t remember all the instances, they were too many to remember. But I can remember the different people. This girl in particular had an affect on me. Other molestations consisted of sex acts that were forced upon me. She did this too but it was beyond sex acts, I had to participate in role playing along with these sex acts. I felt so much fear during all of these acts. All of the molestations gave me fear. I was molested many times by many people after this girl moved but this girl was the one who trained or taught me to act in a hypersexual manner. To engage in sex acts and “act” like I wanted it. This is a lot like my alter. She acts on the teachings of this girl. But why now? Why at 22 years old? This happened years ago.. I just don’t understand. I could never wonder if this was normal, if this was something that happened to other kids. I was always on fight or flight mode in a sense. I had to fend for myself, I could not focus on other kids. I try to tell myself that adults were not there for me. That I need to be easier on myself because I had to fend for myself. That dissociation was the only way I could cope with these events. The molestations, the beatings, the humiliation. But I am angry at myself for dissociating. I still don’t know what else I could have done as a child to cope with these events but I wish it wasn’t dissociation. Even now, I am not sure how I would cope if this all happened to me now. But a woman in a video I watched, who I think was a therapist or psychologist said it is an immature way to cope. I felt angry. I was not immature. I was a very mature child. I did the best I could to save myself. To cope with the emotions from the horror of my childhood. It was horror. I cannot accept that this happens to other children because seeing it from a second hand perspective will make me feel things that I tried to avoid for myself. I cannot process the idea of this happening to another child. I have trouble telling the ages of children. I think in a way it helps me protect myself from realizing how small I was when all these events took place. I once thought a 10 year old was 5. I still can’t accept she was not 5. I could not have been so small and young when this all began. No way. I must have been taller, weighed more, looked more mature. Im not even angry towards the people who did this to me. I feel nothing towards the people who did this to me. But I am angry at myself for how I coped with it. I am angry because of how it affects me now and how it has affected me. That was not me. That was my alter but I have to take the fault. I have to accept the consequences because it was my body. I can’t explain what it is like to have two personalities or how out of control I am. I keep telling myself that if I even had a bit of control over my alter then I wouldn’t have done the things that I did. But I don’t have control over the alter and still don’t. I am not angry at myself for the alter because it really is like getting possessed. That’s out of my control but I am so angry with my alter. I try to tell myself that there was no “mature” way I could cope with the events. I could not reach out to an adult. The adults knew. The adults were in on it. The adults were complacent. Some enjoyed watching while others were too uncomfortable to say anything. They did not want to feel uncomfortable by acknowledging the molestations or bringing them up so they preferred not to say anything. They did not just ignore that I was being molested but they chose to allow it to continue because it would be too uncomfortable for them to confront it. I was a child. You do not even have a full understanding of what is happening but you experience all the feelings that come with it. You experience the fear that persists through all the molestations, no matter how many times you have been molested the fear never goes away. You experience the feeling of being uncared for. I felt worthless as a child because I was never worth defending. I felt like this was normal, like maybe being complacent or too uncomfortable to confront the molestations was perhaps normal and even acceptable. I was truly on my own throughout all of the molestations. I cannot accept that. I cannot accept that I coped through dissociation. If only I had coped another way I would not have an alter. If only. I already went through so much and just wanted to forget about it. I can sweep it under the rug and focus on other things as much I want but my alter was a manifestation of everything I had swept under the rug. My alter is the only consequence I can’t kick to the curb because I am not in control of my alter. I cannot control when the alter takes over or what the alter does, like a possession. It truly was like a possession and for a while I thought maybe I had been possessed. I can throw out the drugs, I can pretend I never used drugs, i can ignore the addiction, I can leave the drug use in the past because it is not something that people can know about if they did not see me use. I can hide the alcoholism because it is not something people would know about if I did not tell them. I cant hide my alter, I have no control over my alter. My alter affects me and others around me. My alter has hurt people. My alter has hurt my image, my alter has hurt me. My alter has hurt me so much.",mentalhealth,I hate my alter,Personality,

1,"I’ve struggled with shaking my entire life. Everyone has shaky hands or whatever but mine were always just a little bit more shaky than everyone else. But now they are off the charts. My hands shake excessively, I can’t really eat with a spoon without getting whatever the spoon held all over the place. And when I drink from a cup, I usually get some of it running down my face because my hands just had to jerk and make the drink splash me. 

I cant balance on one foot anymore, and whenever I walk down stairs I shake uncontrollably: it looks like I’m freezing my ass off in Alaska or something. 

But the worst ones are when I get anxious (my tremors do not stem from anxiety btw), my tremors get so bad my body shakes like I’m on a rollercoaster. Anything in my hands is across the room, if I’m sitting my legs are hitting the chair or floor rapidly like someone is hammering a nail into the wall. My teeth chatter until it hurts. Everything on my body is shaking and I can’t control it for the life of me. I can even get over the anxiety in my head but my tremors just get worse with time.

I wait about 5 more min listening to this voice and I decide to wake up my girlfriend and ask her if she hears anything and she says no.

1,"hi so idk if this is the right place to post this, if it isn't just let me know and i can take it down. i just don't know what else to do

so im a 16yo girl and i have this problem where i feel like important people in my life are watching me from inside my mind. for example, today i felt that my aunt (who im pretty close with) was able to see inside my mind and through my eyes. she could see everything i was doing and could relay this information to anyone she wanted. it switches between different people (ie my parents, friends, crushes, family members, one time even my dead grandmother).

it's not necessarily a huge problem, but it kind of affects the way i act and behave. when my crush was watching me, i happened to be showering. i didn't want them to see me without clothes so i closed my eyes for almost 10 minutes and nearly broke my foot trying to walk back to my room to change. even when im not necessarily doing anything that i wouldn't want people to see, i try to act in a way that makes the person in my head approve. when it's my mom, i never cuss and am really careful about what i let myself see. when it was my dead grandmother, i got extremely upset (i loved my grandma very much) and spent two hours writing down things i would tell her if she were alive. i hoped that she could look through my eyes and see what i was writing.

the people can't see all of my memories/thoughts, but if i see something, they can access any thoughts or feelings about it. thats why im not getting anywhere on google. it's weirdly specific. for example, my aunt saw a sweater that was on my bed and immediately knew that i love it because someone i love gave it to me. thats the worst part about this probably. people seeing what i see sucks, but people knowing about my personal thoughts just freaks me the fuck out.

i know that it's completely ridiculous and that there's nobody inside my head. but i cant stop myself from feeling like there is. at this point, it's pissing me off and i want it to stop so that i can be my normal self. if anyone knows whats fucking with my head or how to stop it, i would really appreciate if you could tell me. i'm not able to talk to a school counselor bc of the pandemic and i doubt i would be able to get therapy/get my parents to help me. thats all.",mentalhealth,i feel like there are people i know inside my mind,Personality,

1,"I can honestly say that the world would be a better place without me. I’m a creepy, bizarrely mannered man and my social skills are terrible because I never got the chance to actually learn them.

I’m that one guy you know and wish that you didn’t. I promise you I’m him. I’m a shitty, childish edgelord with a crippled ego, I constantly try to look smart when I talk, I have no friends, only people who call me their friend because they feel bad for me. People constantly patronize me because I look legitimately mentally challenged - I have weird mannerisms, wear weird clothes, constantly stutter when I talk and genuinely don’t know how to properly interact with people... I only know how to feel regret and humiliation when it inevitably doesn’t go well.

And every single day I try so fucking hard to fix it but I’m too utterly incapable of understanding how to basically function that the entire effort inevitably goes to waste. It takes the strength of my entire will power every second I am alive to not give up on myself and I’m not even “brave” or “strong” for pushing through it like people try to bullshit me about all the time because I have no fucking choice but to live my shithole life and make an utter ass out of myself whenever I’m unfortunate enough to end up in anyone’s presence and I’m not about to pull the ultimate dick move by making people pay for an expensive fucking funeral and stand around for like 3 hours pretending like I had any actual positive impact on their lives.

I’m seeing a therapist, but she’s constantly telling me all of this bullshit about how nothing’s wrong with me. I sit and talk once a week hearing all of this utter shit about how much potential I have and how great I am; only to walk out into the real world and have reality prove to me the exact opposite as I humiliatingly fail at everything I do and increasingly lose my will to live. It’s not helping at all. Whenever I get a therapist, they never know how to respond to me. In fact, it’ll be a miracle if anyone responds to this god damn post and doesn’t do what would be normal - which would be accurately pinpointing me as a hopeless nuisance and moving on to do better things with their time than acknowledge me. 

I hate how I talk. No matter what I do, I end up sounding either weird, insulting, childish, or arrogant. I can get by when I keep my mouth shut, but if I try to speed the social skills train along just a little bit by talking more, people seem to get annoyed with and infuriated at every single thing I say.

I’m honestly a mistake of a human being and I can safely say that if you met me, you’d agree. I mean I had a shit childhood and was abused in ways so weird you wouldn’t even know how to process it if I told you... but god damn it.

I’m trying so... fucking hard to make things work 24/7 but they are still utter shit. I’m having a breakdown right now as I write this because I don’t have any alcohol in my house to numb myself with.

And before you tell me to pull my head out of my own ass... I am trying to as hard as I can every fucking day. I am well aware of the fact that I am a delusional idiot who deserves every self-inflicted ounce of misfortune he receives so I swear to god if you have any advice about how could slap the honest to fuck daylight into myself and not be an utter shitstain on the face of the earth for approximately 5 seconds that would make me deliriously happy.

I thought about joining the military so that I could get taught what actual fucking pain is and not sit around being a privileged, whiny, self-loathing sack of shit all day, but decided not to because honestly, you need functional people in the military, not fucking batshit insane shut-ins on some kind of circular quest for self-improvement. It would be insulting to the military for me to join simply because I think I’m a dirtbag and it would change me.

Am I just hopeless? If I am then honestly that’s fine. I can swallow that if I have to and already have to a degree by promising myself I’ll never get married, have god forbid have kids, risk subjecting them to the same pain that I went through growing up out by holding the same delusional belief that my parents probably had, thinking they could be better than theirs. 

But actually thinking about all of that is fucking futile too because people aren’t stupid. They know I’m a goddamn mess so they leave me the fuck alone. That’s what I was complaining about in the first place... even though once again, I completely deserve it.

Anyway, if you read that I’m so fucking sorry. No one will probably even see this garbage fucking post and I’m used to it at this point and just utterly ready to embrace the fact that I’m a complete piece of shit and continue to avoid the entirety of humanity for the remainder of my life for honestly both my own good and its good.

I have no idea how to fucking end this thing.

1,"The title sounds cryptic, I know, but please bear with me. This is a problem I deal with everyday, but I found myself mulling over it especially hard tonight, and I desperately need outside advice. For those who don't know, ARFID is short for Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder. To directly quote [https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org](https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/) ""ARFID is similar to anorexia in that both disorders involve limitations in the amount and/or types of food consumed, but unlike anorexia, ARFID does not involve any distress about body shape or size, or fears of fatness. A person with ARFID does not consume enough calories to grow and develop properly and, in adults, to maintain basic body function.""

I know picky eating is a thing, but this isn't just pickiness. It just can't be. I've scoured the internet, and ARFID is the closest thing I can find to describe my problems with food. I'm 23 and my palette is limited to about 10 things, none of which can be considered healthy. (Fries, Pizza, and Mac and Cheese, just to name a few.)  I eat one fruit, no vegetables, and a couple nuts (peanuts and almonds).  Every time I'm introduced to a new food, I just smell it and stare at it. If I'm brave enough, I'll try it, but it usually never goes over well. The texture will hit my tongue and feel disgusting, or it'll taste awful, and I'll immediately gag and spit it out. If I can't spit it out, I'll become nauseous and puke. It's been this way for as long as I could remember with nearly everything new I've tried. Everyone in my life has tried to get me to expand my palette, but never in a good way. The many things that they tried were: I would be forced to sit at the table for hours into the night until my plate was clean (which would never happen), someone would give me something new under the ""just try one bite"" pretense and stare me down as I tried it; while they watched my every move and facial expression, or they would just force it into my mouth and become enraged when I spit it out.  There was even a time where my stepdad made me drink this disgusting green Bolthouse juice that had a bunch of different fruits and vegetables in it. It was a miracle I even got that down my throat because it was so disgusting, the taste alone nearly made me puke. I had to hold my nose and drink it like medicine. These kind of things happened all the time in my childhood, but the worst was when my sperm donor (dad) got really irate one night, grabbed my plate, and threw it across the kitchen, where it then hit the sink and shattered into tiny pieces. He then got in my face and screamed so loud he left my ears ringing. It's been years since then, but I can still remember it as though it just happened yesterday. So yeah, people didn't take my eating habits well. Even to this day they still don't. My family pokes fun at me constantly about how ""I'm so picky I'll only eat 10 things"", my mom constantly tells people how she's worried for my health, and my friends/roommates constantly try to get me to try new stuff, but they gather around me and stare at me when I go to try it. Then they get aggravated when I don't like it. And the worst part? I have Lupus. The nutrients my body needs, I'm not getting. Doctors have told me that if something doesn't change, and soon, I won't have a long life. But I just don't know how to change. I want to be healthier, but every time I think about eating something new I immediately become nauseous and on the verge of tears. I'll get so anxious that I have actual panic attacks, which then send me into Lupus Flares (which make me feel even worse). The subject of food has brought me to tears on numerous occasions. Even now, as I sit here and write this, I feel like I'm going to start crying at any minute, and I can feel my heart beating against my chest.

I hate living like this. I feel like I'm constantly being pressured, being stared at, and being judged. I hate going to any kind of parties or social gatherings because I'll only eat maybe one or two things there, and then when I don't eat I get asked why I'm not eating, and then my friends or family will answer with something like ""Oh she only eats like five things"" Or ""She doesn't like anything you have."", which then causes the host to ask me all kinds of questions that I hate answering. It's gotten to the point where I never go anywhere anymore, and when I do I'll only drink water or soda, no matter how hungry I am. I've even gone entire days without eating because I just don't want people to ask me questions. And when they do, I'll lie and say that my stomach is upset and I just don't feel like eating, which usually gets them to leave me alone. I'll even stay up late into the night just so I can eat when no body is around. Planning meals is a nightmare for me, because in my house, we plan meals that everyone likes so that everyone gets a say. But you know who's severely limited? Me! I tell them to plan around me and I can practically see the annoyance in their faces. I have a lot of problems, mental and physical, but my food hang ups are the biggest problem in my life. If I could just snap my fingers and eat like a normal person I would. If I had one wish, I wouldn't wish to be rich or powerful or anything like that, I would just wish to have the palette of a normal f\*\*king human being. This problem is the source of much of my self-loathing and anguish, and it seems like nothing I do can change it. I know that my doctor's are right, and if I don't change my eating habits I will die, especially given the severity and complications of my Lupus. But even being faced with a literal life or death choice isn't enough to help me. I want to change, I really, truly do. I don't want to die.

1,"I think I'm at the lowest point I've ever been in. All my healthy coping mechanisms don't work anymore. I've resorted to hitting myself in the head when I'm angry and ripping pieces of my hair out. I lash out at the smallest things, then go into a days long depression slump. It's for the stupidest reasons too. Everyone got their takeout food except for me a day ago, and I had to eat leftovers while everyone else got to eat their meals. I'm still crying about it and hitting my head. I know logically it's not that big of a deal, but God it feels like the end of the world. 

I've lost every little bit of motivation I had. Even the stuff that used to make me happy doesn't anymore. I used to love to read and write. I've tried to force myself to do these things again, and it just ends with me, again, crying, ripping my hair, and hitting my head. Nothing makes me happy anymore, and it feels like such a chore to do anything.

My only two friends are getting tired of me. One of them I've fallen for, but he's in a relationship. Only sees me as a friend unless it's for sex. I know the friendships toxic, but I absolutely adore him and he's one of the few support systems I have. I don't think I could mentally handle leaving him. 

I hate my therapist. Always asking the same questions every session, not making any progress, forget key details about me. I understand that she has a lot of patients, but it would be nice if we didn't always spend the same amount of time discussing shit we've already been over. She wants me to go to outpatient group therapy. There is no way in hell I'm going. I feel repulsed at the idea of sharing my issues with a bunch of strangers. I'm happy that it helps other people, but I can't do something like that. I don't even like doing it with my therapist, but I'm forced to see her. 

My suicidal thoughts are out of control. Everyday I've  considered it. I have a belt tied around my door knob, bit don't have the courage to do it. I can't even discuss this with my therapist without being sent to the mental ward.

I was gonna vent about the emotional Christmas I had but idk where to start with that tbh. 

But like I've had some weird mood swings where in the morning I'm chill but later I'm just empty and sad and literally really do just want to die. Like I've just had the most surreal most vivid desires lately to just stop existing. To just go to the bath and end it. I won't, but man I'm just tired of everything. I feel so empty all the time. I can't remember shit. I can't look back on happy memories because I just can't remember at will. I don't know who tf I am as a person. I'm just an empty blob. What do I like? What do I want? What do I want to do? I feel nothing towards it all. 

It's fucking scary and I hate it. I don't want to feel this way. I don't wanna be this way. I don't wanna be how I am. I just want normalcy. I want to feel normal.

And then I feel bad for my girlfriend because she has to deal with me and my shit. She does so much for me and I try to do as much as I can but I never feelnlike it's enough.

Nothing I do is ever enough to me. Nothing. I never do it right. I never do what I should have done. I could've done more and since I didn't it's soley my fault if things end up different than I wanted. 

I feel all over the place. Disorganized. Then I try and organize my life and I don't stick to my organization and it all goes to shit. 

I want to study but I avoid doing it. I want to work on my coding side projects but I just avoid it all because I don't want to ruin everything or I just can't get the motivation to. So I'll scroll through YouTube the entire time thinking ""I should be doing something else"" and sometimes I will but most of the time I won't.

I hate how I am and I should probably go to a therapist but I can't seem to make the call. I did go awhile back (like 4 years). They did diagnose me with clinical depression and general anxiety and put me on Lexapro which I feel helped but I got too anxious to to see the doctor again once my prescription ran out because I figured they think I was faking everything or something and judge me so I just never got a refill and quit everything cold turkey.

1,"Throwaway account here. This may be a long post, so I'm sorry in advance... I'd be especially interested if there are any therapists here with thoughts. 

I have had what I would consider mild mental health issues since I was a teenager, but nothing that was too unmanageable. Some bouts of insomnia here, a bit of social anxiety there, but nothing too unusual Then, around the age 24, my issues became much more punctuated. I started having panic attacks that became increasingly frequent and more severe over the next couple years. I also started having suicidal thoughts that became increasingly concrete. 

I could tell something was wrong, but I *really* did not want to go to therapy for a few reasons. First of all, I felt my issues were unjustified. Honestly nothing terrible was going on in my life. I have no real trauma, I am financially stable, I'm in a loving relationship, and the only major life changes that were happening were a couple of moves that went smoothly all things considered. Since there was nothing wrong in my life, I felt ridiculous seeking out therapy. Second, I do have a family history of bipolar disorder, and I know that my mom did not react well to the medications she was on. I was scared I would be immediately prescribed something that would have a negative impact, and although my fear was probably overblown, it definitely prevented me from seeking help for a while. Third, therapy is expensive. I'm financially stable, but I'm not made of money, ya know? 

Anyway, my partner recognized that something was seriously wrong, and what finally compelled me to go to therapy was the realization that my panic attacks were impacting his life as well. He was basically playing the role of therapist, and that was unfair to him. So I started going to therapy back in June. It has all been over Zoom because of COVID. 

I've been seeing the therapist every 2-3 weeks for an hour each time. She usually asks me what's going on, and I tell her about my mundane life. I tell her about my happy relationship, my decently enjoyable job, my close friends, and about how despite all these good things, I just do not feel right sometimes. I still can't sleep at night, I have panic attacks, I am often ridden with an overwhelming sense of guilt over every little thing, including stuff that happened years ago, and I have suicidal thoughts. (I have never attempted suicide, but I have considered different plans and methods. Usually when I get to that point I freak myself out and snap out of it, but it's a scary headspace to be in). 

Usually during my actual therapy sessions, I feel overall fine. I dip into these dark head-spaces frequently, but I also seem to come out of them quickly. Often she will ask what triggered these feelings, and I usually genuinely do not know. I literally just couldn't sleep, started crying uncontrollably, and that sent me on a downward spiral for two days. Then on the third day? I snapped out of it. 

Anyway, I'm wondering if I'm just a naturally dramatic and moody person who probably does not need to be in therapy... lol. I really think that most people probably deal with some level of insomnia and anxiety... Mine has definitely gotten worse as I've gotten over, but do I really need to be in therapy? *Does my therapist think I'm wasting her time and just looking for someone to bitch to about my overall good life?* She has never given me a diagnosis or really given many thoughts on my experiences. I kind of appreciate that she lets me talk through things, but I also wish she would be a bit more engaged... It makes me wonder if she just has nothing to say because she recognizes that nothing is really happening with me. 

Anyway, with all the above, I'm left wondering what I am really doing in therapy. What am I gaining from it? Should I be there at all? I realize this is not something anyone can answer definitively on reddit, but I'd love to know your thoughts.

I think Im fine with not having any friends, and day dreaming, but I wish I got my motivation back because it’s been affecting my school work. I stay in my bed all day unless I have to go to the bathroom or get food. I can’t see myself in the future whatsoever, mainly because I don’t like the path I’m going on. I don’t want to be an office worker or be a doctor or a lawyer, I just want to remembered in some way or at least live a fulfilling life that I can love.

1,"Past three nights I spent bawling my eyes out for seemingly stupid reasons. Yesterday it was because I remembered my pet that died about 3 years ago and decided I had not properly made sure that mentioned pet was happy when it lived. The guilt and disgust that I felt crushed me. Today I realized a game I was playing non-stop for the last few days had a flaw that to be honest shouldn't bother me that much objectively or even when taken into consideration that I possibly held a deeper meaning to it. I'm currently in bed in the middle of the night trying to calm down because I was thinking about it trying to fall asleep and just broke down. I literally asked myself minutes ago if my life had any sense to it.

I'm always scared of watching TV shows, movies, reading books or playing games. Whenever I like something I can't stand the thought of it ending. Once after finishing a game I had to stay home for a few days and comfort myself because I couldn't stop sobbing and hyperventilating and silently screaming from the mental pain that I felt. 

I didn't use to be this sensitive and honestly it's scaring me. I can't enjoy things anymore due to me being terrified I'll eventually have to drop it or go through another breakdown. Everything negative I feel is amped up and I can't function. At first I thought it was me not being used to feeling anything at all (I've been depressed for years). But now I've been on meds for ages and it's still the same. 

I have no idea what to do.",mentalhealth,Could frequent breakdowns because of rather trivial things be considered normal?,Personality,

Whenever I feel a certain way (*this* way), I tend to write down my thoughts onto paper. I’m not sure if it’s a good coping mechanism, but I guess it’s working, so that's good enough for me. The date is December 30, 2020, and I’m really fucking sad again. I can’t think. I don’t know how to put my emotions into words anymore. Writing usually helps, but this time I feel as if I’m writing an essay for college. I know what I’m thinking, but for some goddamn reason I can’t write it down! My brain’s in a million places at once, and I don’t know where to start. There’s so many things I would like to talk about, but I don’t have enough time in the world to get to them. Perhaps I should start with the most important things:

**I believe I have Bipolar II Disorder.**

I don’t know how to get it checked out. I might be wrong, so of course I’m not gonna go to the nearest cliff and cry wolf. However, I’ve done my research, and from what I can tell, I definitely show all of the symptoms. I know I’ve experienced hyperbolic episodes; I specifically remember nights where I had so many ideas for projects, I tried all night to get started on them. There was even a time not so long ago where I drove from my house in Ohio to Columbia, South Carolina and back in the span of under a day… with under 45 minutes of sleep.

There’s the unadulterated rage I get all of the time, which helped me become a great football player and weightlifter. I have serious anger management issues at times, and usually take it out on myself when I can’t put on the shoulder pads. I cut myself at times, punch myself in the face at other times. One time I even took a metal chair and bashed my head open. I do this because I put myself down too often. I’m an utter perfectionist to a fault; when I do something that’s below my impossibly high standards, I put myself down because of my mistakes.

There’s also many, many, *many* times where I suffered from depression, including as I write this. Whenever I get these feelings, I can’t even go to the store without feeling extremely anxious, as if a million eyes are staring at me, or making fun of me. I usually stay at home whenever I get these feelings. But then again, I am a college student, and I do have to go to classes; I feel terrible when I’m there, though. I constantly think of suicide, how nobody will care if I just disappeared, and how the world would be better off without me.

I wasn’t always like this. Up until my freshman year of high school, I was a pretty normal kid. I started to get bullied by some of the people that I called ‘friends’ in high school. They would call me things like ‘retarded’ and whatnot. As petty and as mild as this is, it really did and still does mean a lot; It did a lot of damage to me psychologically, and I never really forgave these people after the fact. I don’t know, I feel like an idiot for even talking about this. Moving on, sorry.

**I put myself down for the stupidest shit and compare myself to others.**

I started talking about this in the last section, but as I was writing, I felt as if it needed its own section. As stated previously, I’m a perfectionist, and I expect things to go the right way when I do it. Of course, I don’t expect *everything* to go my way; even I know that some things can’t happen, and I don’t want to be a giant baby about it. But for things I can control, such as football, weightlifting, singing, writing, et cetera, I expect it to be done perfectly. When it doesn’t go as I had planned (which is most of the time), the pure rage or deep sorrow kicks in. When it does go my way, I’m on to the next task, not stopping to celebrate my goals, or even be happy about the finished product.

I don’t know how to stop the perfectionist in me, nor do I know when it first started, but it seriously is a problem and I know I need to cut it out. However, I do like being how I am in some things, singing being one example. I absolutely *hate* the stuff I recorded earlier in the year, because I know I can improve on it. The same goes for writing: I did something for a local writing contest in the eighth grade. It was garbage! The other week I went back and revised it. *So* much better.

I also like comparing myself to others for no apparent reason. I can squat 485 pounds, which is pretty decent in its own right. But then I look at YouTube, and people are out here squatting 500, 600, even 700 pounds! While it is good motivation, striving to be as good as them, I push myself way too hard, and there’s a good chance I will injure myself trying to achieve their weight. The same can be applied to anything I do; I can’t even touch Call of Duty anymore, because I strive to be the best. When I die, I get extremely angry over it, and inevitably throw something and cut myself. I can’t have fun playing multiplayer games anymore, it sucks!

I don’t know. For now, I’m feeling a little bit better, so I guess I'll stop writing for tonight. Maybe tomorrow will be a better day. Here’s to 2021, I suppose. Cheers.",mentalhealth,"I write my thoughts whenever I'm feeling really down. This is what I wrote today, December 30.",Personality,
1,"Hello,

I'm writing this post to see if anyone can give me some advice. I've been having this anxiety problem over the last few months. However, nothing I've read either online or from conversations from people accurately describes what I'm feeling.

A few months ago, I had a vacation from work. It was only 3 days, however, because of the corona virus situation, work had been pretty stressful this year so I was looking forward to this break so much. My girlfriend and I had booked a hotel in this small village in the mountains. On the first day down there, I was unbelievably relaxed. It had been raining a lot but I kind of like that. Riding the train and seeing the grey skies and cloudy mountains was so beautiful. I was also reading an amazing book and it was the first time I had felt really captivated by a book in months. I also remember listening to some beautiful music while looking at the landscape outside and reading. Basically, the first day I was so relaxed.

However, on the second morning, I got into an argument on Twitter. Now, I get into arguments with people online occasionally. Sometimes I feel I win the argument, sometimes I lose. I always get stressed by arguments. I don't know why I did I got involved in this argument, but I did it anyway os obviously I was stressed. If this argument was on a normal day (at work or at home), I would get annoyed by this for a few hours and then move on. However, this was different. I suddenly started to become incredibly stressed and anxious because I was worried I wasn't going to be able to destress and enjoy the holiday. Then, this anxiety about being anxious then started to become dominant. I started to worry what if I never stop being anxious this holiday. Then, I started to think what if I never stop being anxious over the next few months. I kept thinking about things in the future that I was looking forward to, and then I started to get anxious that I might feel this anxiety in the future, ruining these moments. Then this anxiety started to become automatic. It was no longer a conscious thing, it started to become a pre-reflexive anxiety.

Now, months later, I'm still feeling this anxiety. This anxiety has never stopped. Now, this anxiety is completely pre-reflexive. I have no control over it anymore. The worst thing is, this happens in moments when I am relaxed. All the things that I used to do to control stress and anxiety, are now the things that make me feel anxious. Reading a book, listening to music I like, riding my bike through the city at night, walking home to the sound of raindrops and summer insects, spending time with my girlfriend and cat, watching a beautiful sunset etc. All these things that made my life enjoyable and wonderful are now things that give me anxiety. If I ever start to feel relaxed, this anxiety automatically comes up.

Also, it's not only pleasurable things that give me anxiety. Now, it's any strong emotion that brings up this anxiety. For example, my cat recently went through surgery. Instead of being able to fully worry about my cat, I instead felt this blunt anxiety. I also imagined how if a close relative died, instead of being able to grieve, I would instead just feel this blunt anxiety.

This blunt anxiety has taken over all my emotions. and I don't know what to do. The reason why I haven't been able to find help online is most of the suggestions that are there to help with anxiety are exactly the things that cause anxiety for me now. All the things that I value in life and make life enjoyable are things that are being completely spoiled by this blunt anxiety. 

I want to make the point that this anxiety is not directional. There is no specific reason for it. In the past, there was always a reason why I got anxious (money issues, work etc). However, once I solved those problems, that anxiety was able to go away. This is instead always here, with no specific reason. I will be honest. I haven't had a bad year compared to a lot of people. I'm incredibly lucky. I haven't lost my job, my money and housing situation are okay, I have a great girlfriend and cat. My life is alright at the moment. This is why it's so frustrating that I feel this. I just want to be able to feel relaxed and enjoy all the things that I used to. I can think of more examples of when this anxiety comes up, but I feel like this post is already a bit too long.

Is there anyone who has felt a similar thing, or has any advice on how to help? Should I seek anxiety medication? 

TLDR: I'm stuck with this blunt anxiety that I have no control of with no direction that has taken over all my feelings. The things I used to use to relax are specifically the things that cause this anxiety.",mentalhealth,Anxiety Problem - Can't find anything that describes my symptoms,Personality,

1,"Getting to a psychiatrist was easy for me because I don’t really have this issue with mental healthcare, but physical healthcare scares me to death.

I can’t ever shake this feeling of dread, and I can’t stomach going to a doctor - because even though getting acknowledgement that it’s not as serious as I thought might help, I can’t bear the thought of having to actually go through any actual medical ordeal if it is something serious.

1,"Hi, I enrolled into an English kindergarten when I was and then went to an international school because foreigners weren’t allowed to go to local schools and my parents wanted me to speak English because they can’t. So before that I could only speak Chinese.
However afterwards, when I was 9 I had to learn Chinese as a foreign language because our school had 30mins of Chinese and they put me in the best class without testing me and I can’t write a thing but I could read. The Chinese teacher was disappointed so she asked for my house’s phone number so she could talk to my grandma (those two soon turned into essay enemies because whenever she gave us an essay to write GRANDMA would write it for me and I had no choice but to copy because I couldn’t write a thing myself and at that time I couldn’t even type! So the Chinese teacher even ended up reading my grandma’s political thoughts TWICE &lt;—my little sis was the same) 
Once in Ch I was forced to write a 500word essay but I can’t with CH, I could easily do this with English  and with CH, my ‘essays’ or book reports looked like:
Hello everyone! Today I am going to talk about—- well, the teacher forced me to write this essay, I didn’t want to so yeah look at the sky the weather is very good... let’s start.
I think this book is very boring because I hate reading in general and it is in Chinese hahahaha don’t ask me more questions it even made me sleep so now I am only counting on the words to reach 500. Wait is it 500yet? Let me check....lalalalallalalalalala nonono it isn’t 500 yet so let’s put more fillers. You know how nice the weather is...

You get the idea. To this day my Chinese is still the same...But with English I could write it without fillers and I think in English...
So, since I was forced to learn Chinese, I hate it to the point where I avoid joining clubs that speak it...cuz I will be exposed to the language... yuck.however I am in Taiwan and I am Taiwanese and I am used to the international environment so it feels weird to only be with 1 race so I only join international communities.  I also hate it to the point that whenever an ad pops up and it is voiced in CH I will immediately mute it. Let alone getting a boyfriend unless he can speak English fluently without a foreign accent. 

However in East Asia and Southeast Asia,even ppl holding a PHD can’t speak English without an accent... unless they have the same background as me or they r from the Phi (some Philippines speak English without their accent, idk y) and sometimes Malaysia and Singapore.

And on FB, I ended up speaking their language instead because they don’t other speaking English after knowing that I can speak their language (I also can speak Japanese, Spanish, French and Portuguese and I am learning another Asian language) and they just gave me advice in their language whenever I posted a question.

1,"Not sure if this is where this goes, but Imma ask anyway. 

I () have had what might be auditory hallucinations since the end of my eleventh grade year. I’m not even sure if they are hallucinations even. It started out as simply hearing voices when I started to doze off as I fell asleep at my co-op while waiting for my mom to pick me up. That I just brushed off as me falling asleep and half dreaming. 

A few months after that I heard a voice from my phone one morning, I was putting it down to get up and I heard a distinct male voice saying “Fuck” or something along those lines. I, of course freaked out and went to my oldest sister (19F). I thought that someone had somehow hacked my phone and was watching me through it or something.  She went through my apps, deleted any odd ones and gave it back. And I pushed it to the back of my mind. 

A few months back, I had another episode, I was up way to late, (like 2 AM, which might have contributed to it) I put down my phone to finally sleep and this time I heard a woman’s voice saying “thank god, she’s finally going to sleep.” I didn’t mention this to anyone, and I forgot about it. 

Today, I came home, and went up to my room. As I entered I heard a very loud buzz, but as if someone was making a buzzing sound (and doing it badly) it only lasted a second. But it freaked the fuck out of me. I called for my family, but they didn’t hear me, and that drove me to tears. I know I sound like a big baby, but I was alone in my room, scared shitless of a sound coming from my bed and noone could hear me in my mind. Plus I have been paranoid before that people have been watching me in my room, or stalking me. 

My family finally came in, and when I told them  what was going on, they just sort of, dismissed it. I mentioned that I had heard a buzzing sound, and they tried saying that it was raccoons in the ceiling (I knew it wasn’t, he scuttles not buzzes) or that it was the electrics, (I have barely any wiring in my room). I kept trying to explain that that wasn’t it, but they just kept ignoring me. 

I have given up, they were talking about how, I might have subconsciously heard something like the buzzing and am making the hallucinations up on my own. (But they make it sound as if I’m doing it on purpose) And I’m really starting to spiral. 

Basically, I’m asking if there might be something wrong with me. On past occasions, I’ve been tired, or nearly asleep and that can cause Auditory Hallucinations I’ve heard, but this last time, I was completely awake. My parents aren’t the most open to the idea of Mental illness and I wanted to get other opinions before I press the matter, Thanks.

I finally finished therapy and i was doing great but one little trigger and i already wanna die?! Wtf. No one has to comment or anything. I just want someone to listen to me. Maybe I'm too sensitive to be alive, why was i born like this? I hate myself so much. But if you're reading this, i hope youre happy. I hope youre not like me.

1,"In a really big shortcut a while ago I made my best friend cry. We had an argue and I said some things because of which she started crying. I told her some things that I don't like in her and I said it in the wrong way. I was a bad person at that time and now when I've changed I feel like I should get some kind of punishment for that. I'd prefer to just make it up for her, but we've lost contact long time ago and there is no way of contacting with her. I Just feel bad for what I did. The worst thing man could do is make a girl cry and that's what I did, I hate myself because of who I was.",mentalhealth,What would be best punishment for me?,Personality,
1,"A few years ago I had a nasty break up with my first partner and it was incredibly toxic to say the least. I had been going through some serious serious issues with my mental health and took it out on them. I was emotionally manipulative and just overall horrid to be around. Eventually I worked through it and my ex and I are good friends now. 

But sometimes I question if it is really possible that I have changed. I have been in a new relationship for about a year and have been very happy. My current partner says they have seen drastic improvements with me and that I am definitely a better person now. For some reason I am convinced that I have fooled myself and them that I’m different. I am hung up that yes even though I don’t do toxic things anymore and yes i’ve worked through my depression and anger issues that that person still exists inside me. That someday I could just lose control and go back to how I was.

I love my current partner and I care so much about my ex, I don’t want to hurt either one of them. Do you think it’s possible that I have changed for the better? Can people change in general?",mentalhealth,Is it possible that I have changed?,Personality,
1,"A few months ago, I got back from Boot Camp (USMC) I was discharged due to Heart Issues and Rhabdomyolysis. I came home to all my old friends refusing to speak with me, completely ignoring me, or just shitting on me altogether. All I had lwft was my Girlfriend. My Dad left us his house and bills while he is with his Girlfriend. Haven't seen him in the 5 months I've been back. Mom passed away in October, and Christmas my Girlfriend broke up with me. I've been feeling these feelings for a while which I blame on my severe Gender Dysphoria... I hate being apart of the LGBT Community, I do. I don't hate LGBT people, I just never wanted to be a part of the community. I wanted, still want as a matter of fact to just be a normal Guy. In alot of ways my Girlfriend supported me, brought me out of my shell alot and helped me start realizing who I was. Christmas though, we broke up. She made a remark that I didn't seem to be taking it too hard, but I am... I don't cry for anything. When mom passed I didn't, when I came home I didn't,  when Girlfriend broke up with me I didn't. It feels like I want to cry all the time but nothing ever comes out. I just feel so drained and empty, I just don't feel alive anymore. It feels like I'm in a void that I can't escape. Alchohol only gets me so far... I don't know what to do...",mentalhealth,The only thing I feel anymore is Anger or sadness. Not even strongly either. I don't feel anything.

1,"Having anxiety and depression together can be so dang confusing sometimes. The depressed part of me doesn’t care about my health or just care about myself in general, I don’t really take all my medications and just don’t generally take care of myself. The anxiety part of me however has convinced me that I have covid because I coughed twice in the past week. Like I have no other symptoms but here I am checking my temperature every 5 mins because I’m just waiting for it to go up. Mental health is too confusing, like I don’t even understand.",mentalhealth,Anxiety and depression together is so confusing,Personality,
1,"SORRY THIS IS LONG PLS READ BUT ILL PUT A TLDR - last week i was really happy and i felt “free” and stuff and i’ve been learning how to be okay with being alone. now i feel like i’m too okay with it. i don’t really care to respond to my friends text (except my best friend because we don’t text that often) , i mean i do but only because i feel like i have to. lately i would be fine with not texting them at all but every now and then i text them first because i know our friendship depends on it, not really because i want to. and it’s not like i don’t want to be friends with this person i do but it seems like now i got easily irritated at their texts and it makes me not want to respond anymore. now remember how i said i felt genuinely happy ? now this week, i’ve been doing less ok. i’ve been gradually losing more and more energy and motivation to get up. i’ve been staying up all night. waking up 2-3 pm. i don’t get up from my bed except to pee and eat. i haven’t showered or brushed my teeth or washed my hair even tho i need to fr. usually i brush my teeth though but today i skipped. just yesterday i thought i had narcissism. i don’t think i do tho. i was just thinking about how i feel like i’m having less empathy. i feel less human. like, bc of the friend thing and stuff so i searched it up. i related to more of the symptoms than i thought, but i don’t think i have it, bc i don’t think that anyone is below my level and only higher status should talk to me. that same night i struggled with my identity. i googled some mental disorders, i think i was just overthinking it because i don’t think i struggle enough to actually have any , but i figured having one is better than actually being this way by like, choice ? 
TLDR; i’m starting to have less empathy and not enough energy/motivation to respond to anyone, i get easily irritated at my friends texts, i feel less human. i was just happy last week. am i mentally unstable? do i need to see someone?",mentalhealth,"am i mentally stable, am i a bad friend/person?",Personality,
1,"This is hard to explain to people but I’m so confused. Basically I’m having a hard time believing myself? What made me post this is I get really bad migraines and they’ve gotten progressively worse over the years, to the point that I’ve been taking excedrin most days out of the month. Christmas day it was so bad and I was in excruciating pain for most of the day, medicine wasn’t helping. Obviously this isn’t good for me, so I want to go to the doctor. 
But as soon as I finally made the decision to make an appointment today I started doubting myself? Thinking maybe my migraines aren’t even that bad and I’m just being dramatic? Even though when I’m going through it I tell myself I need to make an appointment immediately and I can’t live like this. 
These situations where I doubt myself over obvious things have happened before though and I have no idea why. It makes me feel crazy. Why am I doubting reality?? Am I literally losing my mind or am I rightfully calling myself out for just being dramatic? I feel insane because I don’t even know what to believe. Has anyone else experienced this or does anyone have advice?",mentalhealth,why do i keep doubting basic things?,Personality,
