1,"So my therapist recommended to me that I should post on reddit. I'm currently 18 but the story starts when I was 16 in the summer of 2019. I live in the UK and it was the day I received my gcses. I did really well in them and I got 8 A*s and 2 As after a year of hard work and effort. I was at my highest point and I couldn't believe it. The day after however, my cousin tragically passed away in a freak accident in Mexico that should never have happened and I was suddenly thrown into a whirlwind of people grieving around me and panic surrounding how they were going to get his body back and many other things. Initially I thought I was doing okay but a week and a half later, I had my first panic attack. It was terrifying, I genuinely thought I was having a heart attack and that I was going to die. This was my first introduction into my hypochondria and anxiety. For the remainder of the summer I was in a constant state of anxiety and panic - struggling to sleep, eat and petrified about death. During the gcses I was also getting close to a girl who was in my year (we'll call her Anna). However during the early summer Anna got with another guy and things died out after she told me we're no longer on things. After things didn't work out with that guy she messaged me again saying that she wanted to reset things with me (little to my knowledge she was also getting close to another guy during this time). When I went back to school I was still suffering from anxiety and panic - I was quite, unable to speak to anyone from how bad it was. During the first 2 weeks, I was getting close with Anna again and eventually we started to go out.

Initially things were going good, my anxiety started to die down and I no longer was having panic attacks. However soon the anxiety returned and manifested itself in different ways that weren't as noticeable with paranoia, fear and depressive episodes due to the fact that she wasn't exactly loyal in the past. Eventually with lockdown things started to get bad. She naturally has quite an abrasive personality but it usually was counterbalanced by her more tender side. However that started to change over lockdown and she started to become very toxic towards me - calling me unattractive, not her type, pathetic etc. This carried on and culminated in her out right treating me like shit where she'd refuse to even speak to me if she didn't like the restaurant I took her to on a date. There are way more examples and stories of this that I can give - even the time she sexually assaulted me which I don't want to get into. But I stayed, I loved her and being with her was the thing that helped me stop being constantly an anxious and nervous wreck. I saw her as the person that I went out with at the start not the person she became.

Eventually I couldn't bare it anymore and I broke up with her in October but now the skeletons in my closest have opened and all the feelings I had have returned. For the last 2 months I haven't been eating or sleeping well and I've been constantly anxious. I now also borderline have a panic attack whenever I see her at school too. I'm now seeing a therapist but it took a month - I didn't think I needed help, it can be scary but it can honestly be the best decision you can make. I'm more optimistic about things now and I can see the light at the end of the tunnel.",Anxiety,My story of anxiety and an emotionally abusive relationship,Trauma and Stress ,Relationship
1,"Hey all! I'd like to start this thread to maybe help each other check in on 'filling the cup.' My anxiety embeds itself as relationship anxiety and in-home anxiety, where being home too much makes me intensely anxious, feeling totally empty, useless and lonely. I have a hard time just hanging out (you can imagine what 9 months of COVID has done to me in this regard.) I've started making a daily practice of creating a 'Ways to Fill My Cup' list, so that I feel less empty and anxious. It's helping me A LOT to check out which things make me feel most supported and calm. I make a list starting in the morning and add to it if I do other positive things during the day. 

Example: Yesterday I had no plans, and the impending day of loneliness at home was looming dark and large. So my ""Fill My Cup"" list ended up pretty long. On it were things like: Finally doing my dishes, putting on the Chillhop ambient sound spotify playlist which was amazing for my busy mind, unpacking all of my Christmas items which makes my space feel more clean, spending time on my skin and teeth care which I sometimes neglect and then feel bad about, watching one hour of a comforting show, calling one friend, scrubbing neglected kitchen/bathroom spots with clorox wipes, watching funny animal videos, and more. This seems like a normal day of tasking, but since I also have ADHD, I often neglect things or am not consciously 'checked in' to doing them, so it has no impact on my emotional wellbeing.

Writing these items down so that I could SEE that my day wasn't totally 'wasted' in 'emptiness' was a huge deal for me. I spent time being productive and also time just being my own friend. Adding to it throughout the day kept me focused on the actual imagery of filling up my cup. My mind stayed relatively calm throughout. 

Does anyone else engage in a similar practice? If not, do you think it might help you? Let's talk!!",Anxiety,How do you fill your empty cup?,Trauma and Stress ,Loneliness

1,"I've been working at a job (~6 months so far) that requires me to communicate on the phone effectively, and know a lot about the details my job (which a lot comes from experience). Before this job, I had no phone experience and I had extreme phone anxiety (I probably have social anxiety which contributes greatly to it). It took me a lot of effort to push past my anxiety and start using the phone. I still have anxiety but I am better at dealing with it. 

Anyways, I was trying to help a customer, and I was feeling extra nice so I put in extra effort for this woman. Unfortunately, I wasn't experienced in one area of my job so I couldn't answer a couple of her questions. The customer said that she was tired of me not being able to answer her questions and that it is sort of ridiculous. She didn't thank me for the previous work I did either. I told her I would get her a more experienced person. I get it, I'm supposed to be an expert at my job, but damn it really crippled my confidence to hear her say that. I felt like I was working hard, but, in that moment I felt like it was meaningless. I put in effort and was rewarded with a negative experience and lots of negative feelings. 

The experience after the phone call was just me feeling sad and overwhelmed. I drove home after work and almost cried lol. I feel pathetic that I can't handle angry customers and I am second-guessing if this job is really going to work for me. 

I don't know what I want from this. No one will read it anyways.

sometimes when i get overwhelmed and upset and start crying i have trouble breathing properly. like hyperventilating i guess?? but im not entirely sure bc its not FAST but its uncontrollable and is kinda like gasps.

but the thing is sometimes i dont really think it happens from anxiety?? it happened today at work when my manager *gently* scolded me and that + the stress from the busy day just made me start crying. i guess i was a little anxious but i just felt bad and a little stupid for the mistake i made

this doesnt happen every time i cry tho. ive had times ive cried a lot harder than when i have during these and i could control my breathing

1,"Hi people of Reddit.

Normally I wouldn't find myself in this kind of position to write this but the fact is I don't even know how I should handle this now. I started a new job back in June while I still had another job that I enjoyed. I started to notice that I wasn't able to breath (I have asthma) and I used my inhaler a lot and it didn't help at all. Well anyway after a few doctors visits it turns out my anxiety was getting worse. At first it was mostly not being able to breath and it just kept getting worse. I had to quit the one job that I enjoyed because of reasons with the new manager that had just started working there. Anyway so I started putting myself into my other job working a lot and being helpful picking up other people's hours. I have a bag that I carry my medication around in and they have given me some problems with that as well. So moving on to being there a few months and I just find myself getting worse. My anxiety pretty much taking over my life. My depression starting to get worse again as well. I find myself struggling to get the will to even go to work. When I get there I have the routine of taking my medication with no help. While at work I find myself struggling to even be happy. Everyday the same old thing which isn't the problem then comes rude customers, customers who try to make me feel stupid when they are the one being stupid, customers with stupid jokes, and customers who feel they are entitled. I deal with them as best as I can. Next is the other employees who talk trash about other coworkers. Giving me attitude because I had a doctor's note to work in the least populated area of the store, a head cashier telling another person that I was faking it, and another head cashier saying that everyone has anxiety. Okay YES SUSAN (Her name isn't actually Susan) EVERYONE HAS ANXIETY WHY DON'T YOU TELL ME WHEN YOU HAVE FEEL LIKE YOU'RE DYING OR YOU FEEL LIKE YOU CAN'T BREATH OR WHEN YOU DON'T EVEN FEEL LIKE YOU ARE IN YOUR OWN BODY, I'LL WAIT. Anyway time after time my anxiety keeps getting worse. The area that was least populated now is closed due to it being out of season and I'm working as a front entrance cashier again. All I asked was not to have to go out into the isle and greet the customers. Not that I couldn't help customers or even greet them from behind the counter. They are saying it's apart of my job and it's like I can still greet them from behind the counter. They are giving me a hard time about it but there is also people who have doctors notes to sit down. They don't go to the end of the isle to greet people they sit behind the counter and stand up when a customer comes to check out so why can't I stand behind the counter and occasionally sit down when I have a bad disassociation episode. At this point I don't know what to do. They are being unfair to another cashier with anxiety and me. Anxiety ranges a lot and you should accommodate as long as it doesn't cause undue hardship (which believe me it doesn't). Plus with Covid it's not very smart to greet the customers because that makes me close to then and I could be at higher risk than someone my age. I just don't know what to do anymore everyone there is making so hard, that's why I decided to come to you Reddit users for some advice.

1,"Due to the pandemic, I am currently working 3 jobs after getting laid off back in June on top of going to school. One of them is a retail job.

Today I figured out that my bills and expenses outweighed what I had in my account and I was really stressed about it. It crushed me because I pride myself on my own money management. That was the breaking point. This week has been filled with stress from my apartment complex (5 calls and they still haven’t returned my calls...) losing my car keys, neighborhood crime, figuring out how to move, working, and the fact I struggle with many health problems, lead to a very hard few days. Then the money thing was the one that broke the camels back. You could probably see the brokenness in my eyes from a mile away.

I have seen a lot about “your best might look a little different today” and let me tell you I was trying to be my best. My best just meant not talking or interacting with others but I was trying my hardest. I was telling myself that as I was trying not to let the stress make me cry.

This girl came up to my register. She was around my age (25). She must have seen my eyes because she started talking and conversing with me in a very sincere way. She asked if I was doing okay through the conversation after I said something and then was talking about how it’s one of those rocky days for everyone it seems like. She gave me a little reassuring nod and it was like her telling me “you got this girl” before she walked off and wished me a happy holidays.

When I was with him, I was so happy. But, I started having worse and worse nightmares, I was waking up talking in my sleep in the middle of the night. I’d have these little panicky moments, and then he would make everything all better with his nice guy damage. 

And then when it ended I could see it all these patterns of troubling and controlling behavior. How he was causing the panic, and manipulating/gaslighting our relationship. 


I’m currently seeing someone, and he is pretty different for the other guy. He is calm and casual and has a similar personality to me. He is nice and fun and chipper.

1,"I’ve always had GAD and social anxiety and panic attacks, for over 15 years now. With the pandemic and having a new baby my anxiety has only increased, for obvious reasons. My husbands brother &amp; now wife moved where we live about a year ago. While I was pregnant and their children were young (last year) I wasn’t forced to see them so much. Now that our baby is 8 MO my SIL is CONSTANTLY asking to grab coffee, come over, etc. she’s a really shitty mom, mean and condescending to her 1 &amp; 2 year old. My brother in law is lackadaisical and does not watch his kids properly (lets them play in arcades with no shoes, lets them play in retention ponds) basically everything about these 2 gives me anxiety and makes me want to hyperventilate. I’ve explained to my husband multiple times that I don’t agree with their parenting and it makes me want to have a panic attack any time they ask to hang out. They’re children are also ALWAYS sick with fevers, flus (they’re in daycare- even though the wife doesn’t work- she just “can’t handle 2 of them all day”). Also, right before my baby shower she caused a huge fight between us because she asked me to watch her child while she took the other to the ER because she had a 104 degree fever, which I said no because I was pregnant and didn’t want to risk getting sick- she basically told me I’m not family and do nothing for her, yet another reason I can’t stand her and get anxiety just thinking about her. Anyways, I have done everything I can to be safe for my family in this pandemic, I don’t see ANY of my friends, I go nowhere except the grocery store masked and parks with the baby. (Sorry for so much back story just trying to give an understanding) My husband asked today if we could see his brother and kids because the wife is out of town and the brother “knows I don’t like her so if she’s not here maybe we can hang out”. He said he wants our daughter to get to know her cousins. She’s 8 MO. She’s not going to remember them right now. I just want to keep her safe and healthy and these kids are ALWAYS sick, literally every time I’ve seen them.

1,"I know where my anxiety comes from. Doesn't make me any less anxious though. I still get so overwelled I just want to dig a hole and live in it. I love my job working with kids, but the anxiety has me breaking down every other night because it's so stressful. So I tried working as a nanny which has greatly helped with it. Now everyone keeps asking me when I'll get a 'real' job. I hate talking to my family these days. I don't have answers to their questions nor do I care to answer. I feel terrible for feeling like this but I'm so numb to them these days.

My anxiety was mostly manageable until I got into an emotionally and sexually abusive relationship. It completely destroyed me. I know I'm not okay. I tried going to counseling, but the way people talk to me made me feel dehumanized. I'm not a child. I know exactly what you are doing and it's not going to work. I studied psychology in college, but didn't like the field so I didn't get my master's degree. It's making counseling impossible. 

Every night I think about packing up most of my stuff and getting into my car and driving off. I've been feeling lost since my junior year of college when I realized I hated my degree but didn't want to change degrees because I was so close to graduating. 

The only thing that enjoy doing is YouTube and honestly it's a tiny channel where most of the time I look at my effort into it and wonder why I'm doing it. Some days I don't enjoy it. I take a break and then for a few weeks it's okay. Then I start to get stressed again. It's a never ending cycle. 

I have no idea what I'm doing with my life anymore. Working as a nanny forever isn't plausible. I am seriously questioning come the summer packing up my stuff and taking off across the country until I find a place I like. Because living back home is more anxiety inducing then anything.

For me, I was medically retired from the army due to depression, anxiety and even suicidal idealization. I’m still suffering from it but mostly when I start thinking of taking my life, my instincts is to shut those thoughts out.

I feel like I didn’t make the right choices in life, like I didn’t live up to society’s expectations somehow. I’ve never had a serious or even casual relationship, just one night stands or short flings. So I feel like people see that and avoid me.

My family is definitely the most major cause of my anxiety. Ohhhhh my god. I'd say I'm a pretty shy &amp; timid person in general, but I actually do not have that much anxiety around most people. My coworkers don't give me anxiety, my boyfriend's family doesn't give me anxiety, etc. 

BUT HOLY SHIT DOES MY FAMILY GIVE ME ANXIETY. 

Oh my God. So I now just have this like reactionary instinctive fight or flight response whenever I'm around these people. My parents both work, but because God is terrible I work only on the days that my mom, who is definitely the worst offender, is home. 

I even just hear this woman in the kitchen and my heart starts racing, blood pressure rising. No, I'm not afraid this old woman is going to physically assault me or something, but as I imagine is typically among people with anxiety, I had a very stressful childhood and it was my primarily due to her, so the instinctive fear remains. 

She keeps walking in for NO REASON, there is no lock on the door. She just walks in, I'm sure because she knows how much it bothers me, and looks over my shoulder to my computer, analyzing everything I'm doing like she thinks she's gonna catch me like ordering heroin on the dark web or something. 

I work for a charity, over the phone, and I have to talk to people all day. I have made like 2-3x as many mistakes here as I did when I could go into the office, and I've had a lot more complaints because when I'm in this anxious state, I get really defensive and I have never been able to conceal my emotions so they can hear it over the phone. I sound kind of like I'm angry at them, and like 60% of my brain is occupied by focusing on all the fkn noise my mother is making in the kitchen, poised for the moment she might randomly walk in, so I keep making dumb clerical accidents. I just got a call from my (actually very nice) boss asking me why tf I was making so many mistakes and threatening to make me go through training again.

1,"I have diagnosed GAD and take meds for it. My family knows this but still acts very mixed, they see me as an aggressive person due to me getting angry from anxiety attacks and reaction to annoying sounds (misophonia). This is a reason why I stay in my university town for long periods of time, even before the pandemic.

I have barely been home for a whole 24 hours and they're already making me anxious and tired. My mun has mood swings and calls me entitled when I ask for simple things, or if I don't read he remind. No physical punishment but she explodes even as I ask softly for help with something.

I’m a 26 y/o male who has been dealing with generalized anxiety for the last 6-7 years, maybe 8 years..

I had a job recently in retail and was super proud of myself being able to support my family alongside my wife who works full time as well. I haven’t worked the past two years, as I was a stay at home dad and that benefited me because I was spending the days with my daughter and wife when she wasn’t working.

I started feeling off at work, I had about an hour left of my shift so I went to the bathroom and splashed some cold water on my face to make myself feel better, and I did make it through my shift. However, when walking to my car I ended up having a terrible panic attack to the point where I could not drive. I took one of my anxiety meds and eventually got enough courage to drive home (still feeling not the best) but powered through it.

Since that day I have not been able to be out of the house, especially if going to stores for groceries, shopping, etc. 

I was just in Target and today I have not felt well. I have had to take more of my anxiety meds than I have in a while, and still had to leave the store. So now, I get to feel off, tired from my meds and miserable.

1,"I'm a 17-year-old girl, nothing special really. I can't remember exactly when it started. Sometime in 2018, my depression has been, at least what I *think* is depression, on and off and getting worse as of recent. Maybe it's seasonal, I don't really know. I always have this constant feeling of heaviness inside, like a grey cloud that won't go away. My moods go from moderate to empty to extremely sad, and just as often as my feeling the thoughts and wanting to end my life come with them. I've lost motivation to do anything, nothing interests me anymore, I sleep way too much every day, and I always feel tired no matter how much sleep I get. It's also affected my moods greatly, I get irritated at the smallest things and it's caused some problems with my relationship with my parents and siblings...

I haven't told my parents *exactly* how I feel, just that I feel depressed, and I regret ever telling them. You see, my parents grew up in poor single mom households so they had to really toughen up to get by, especially my dad. I'm pretty sure he's bipolar, and I try and avoid him as much as I can. He always tells me to just be happy and to smile and that life isn't worth being sad over, but he says it in a very toxic manner. Toxic positivity you could say. When I came out to both my parents that I was depressed back in 2019, they brushed it off. I told them again months later, but then my dad decided to make fun of me and mock me for feeling depressed and that I needed to stop ""feeling sorry for myself"". He then continued to scare me into not getting any help because antidepressants would ""fuck me up big time"" and that I would end up like my cousin (who is on antidepressants and hasn't reacted well to them). More recently, I came out to my parents *again*, hoping that they would finally understand. I confronted my dad about his actions towards me and he apologized...up until a few days later he barged into my room screaming how he felt ""abused"" (due to me forgetting to take out the garbage that day), and started mocking me about my depression and how I was lazy as hell. His apology never meant anything. If you're wondering about my mom, she's been more ""understanding"" but hasn't done anything to help me until recently when it came down to me crying and begging her to get me diagnosed and get therapy. Even though she's more ""understanding"", she guilt-tripped me about how the way I've been feeling and how it affected the relationship between me and my family. I know the way I've been acting isn't the best, and I'm truly sorry for that, but it's not something I can control. By the way, she likes to guilt trip me, a *lot*.

Hopefully, I can get the help I need soon since we switched to a new insurance. I know that my mom will forget about it and I'll have to remind her constantly. Now that you have the context of what my parents are like, my main question is how do I deal with them and make them understand that I'm actually struggling a lot and I need their support? I'm afraid that even after, if, I get diagnosed/get therapy, my dad will still mock and make fun of me and my mom won't show me that she supports me.

1,"I know, I should probably seek counseling, and I fully intend to, but I am trying to self diagnose first. I also know a Google search will yield some answers, but I felt like letting this air out. It's a very, very lonely place to feel depressed when you're trying to maintain a facade together for everyone around you, and have been for decades.

At the most banal and superficial sense, I appear happy and successful. Good career, reasonably wealthy and debt free with an open path to semi-early retirement, with a wife and young child in a home in a nice neighborhood and a part time nanny to help. It could be PPD I suppose, but I haven't felt particularly ""happy"" for a long time, maybe ever. I just feel no love and affection for either of them - I think I used to feel what I could describe as love for my wife but I've just lost the joy completely in being with her, but I haven't outwardly shown that change. I have little to no emotion with my child, but because I generally have been able to do an incredible job masking my emotions, I play with my child all the time and cheerfully (outwardly) try to help out as much with the child-rearing as I can, while stifling any signs of apathy that I can. I feel nothing when I am with my child. No joy, yet no resentment either - it's just a job that I am trying my hardest to do well in.

I have loving extended family members that care for me and - again outwardly - I care for them. I drive them around (used to, of course - thanks COVID), run errands for them, buy them groceries in the midst of the pandemic etc. I think I would feel sadness for their sake if they passed away for sure, but I wouldn't feel that devastated if I never saw them again either. This honestly goes for my immediate family either - I would be very saddened for them if they were hurt or killed, but I don't know if I will really feel sad myself or miss them. Life will just go on.

Often times I do want to end myself, not because I'm particularly suffering, but because I just feel so little reward for what I am doing. So much of my life is just going through the motions of what I am supposed to do - work hard in school, get a good job, date a good girl, marry her and be a good husband, father a child and be a good parent. I experienced some feelings of happiness in the moment of all of these events, but little lasting joy. Of course, because it's an action I have to take meticulous planning to do, suicide is unlikely I ever go through with it. So much of my life was done and planned on focusing upon things I'm supposed to do, I have no idea how to really do something that I'm not supposed to, and that includes planning a suicide.

I have no real violent or malevolent tendencies and certainly derive no pleasure - mostly revulsion - to hurting other people. So, I am not really a danger to anyone but myself. I do not use drugs and rarely drink alcohol, and have never cheated on my wife. 

I have some interests and hobbies, but nothing I would call a passion. They distract the mind and keep me entertained, but I rarely am too excited about doing them. The only thing I have ever felt really excited and hopeful for was traveling to a new place and immersing myself in a completely different environment, if only for a few days.

No one in my entire life knows this side of me. Even as I type and feel this, I face a mirror and am able to fake the most sincere looking smile and satisfaction. 

I honestly do not know what next step to take. I think the feeling of numbness became particularly apparent that I have fewer distractions and just basically face my family all the time this year because of COVID - the need to fake it so often and all the time is wearing me down. If I had to choose a path for myself, I would probably elect to stay with my family and be the diligent husband, father and employee and live out the rest of my years. I would feel my existence though only serves its purpose for other people - and I mean no disrespect to actually charitable volunteers. 

I don't know what I have or what I am. I will make an appointment early in the new year to find out, but I just wanted to type this out and see what kind of response I get. Perhaps there is someone else like me who feels this way?  Perhaps someone else has known someone that experiences depression (which I think this is) this way? As in, not an active sadness, but a real disconnect and deep underlying apathy for life. 

Also, as if it wasn't obvious, this is a throwaway account, because like in real life, even on Reddit I maintain a sort of false persona where some friends know of my actual username. That account subscribes to a few subreddits discussing hobbies and interests of mine and I post frequently, but I consider them distractions more than actual passions.

I have had a thing with this girl for a very long time. We get along great together. We seem to get one another. We laugh. We dance. We express our true selves to one another, blemishes and all. I have honestly ended other relationships with great women because they don’t do it like this one girl can. They don’t scratch that part of my brain I cannot itch. Alas, there is a problem. She is the sister of my best friend. 

We have been intermittently romantic/sexual numerous of times. And as the days fade away, she always just says she wants to remain friends. That the complexity of the situation scares her. To which I am understanding. I don’t want to jeopardize what I have with her brother. He is truly my best friend. So the situation is less than ideal. 

Routinely I just go on with my life, find another mountain to claim or girl to relieve my sorrows. But I think this time is different. Over Xmas we hooked up, again. We were both wildly intoxicated. In the moment it felt right, perfect. She had just told me a week prior she wanted to be friends. Come the morning after it was awkward. She was cold, distant. Then a day later she made it known again that Xmas was a mistake. That she wanted to remain only friends. I was/am devastated. 

This brings me back to how this time I think it’s different. I feel more sad than usual about the situation. I feel broken. I’m so sad. I’m ready to just give up on a relationship and remain content with only myself. I think she may be the one for me but if we cannot be together all others will not suffice. 

I am trying to look at the positives. She’s great and we can remain close, but maybe not as a couple. But I long for that. Though I do realize I could be just romanticizing the possibilities. She knows how I feel but my fear of driving her further away prevents me with speaking my whole truth. 

Anyway, thanks for listening. I hope things improve for me. And if you’re visiting this sub, I hope things improve for you too. Bye.",depression,"I’ve been here before, yet I’m back again",Trauma and Stress,Relationship

I finally felt good about myself and starting feeling so much better, like I was wanted by someone finally. As soon as it started , it ended.

There was a series of events that had caused a stroke and PTSD in me. Nevermind what happened, it's enough to say it's definitely not a fond memory.

So we have New Year's Eve after a year of getting myself together again, I can even say that I'm quite happy thanks to a soulmate (you know who you are if you're reading this :). And then ""boom!"" - a person not directly responsible for subject trauma then but guilty of neglect (didn't do anything to help while fully aware what was happening) suddenly calls me up to wish me a fuckin happy new fuckin year and ask to meet and talk of ""good old times"".

Fuck it, I metaphorically killed the person that I was at the time (attempted it physically but now glad that it didn't work), why the fuck resurrect her?! They are not fuckin good old times, I got rid of any reminders of that time and changed my life completely. That person is fuckin dead and I want her to stay that way.

1,"Hey, how's it going? To me isn't that great...

To summarize: I lost my job and my grandfather died in the same week. I live in another country with my parents, so part of the money I got from work I sent it to my grandpa's funeral. The catch is that the family did almost nothing for him.

 His body stayed in the house alone for nearly 5 hours or so, they're too lazy to step up and find a doctor. They said the hospital was closed, but my brother there went to the other entrance and found a doctor; my family's too damn stupid to not look around the corner.

Only two uncles, a cousin and my brother were there to bury him because I don't know what in hell the rest of the family were doing. I know that a week later my grandma and aunts were all sharped dressed acting nothing happened at all, smiling and partying like it's sunday...

My anger was such that I assumed that they died for me. They can assume I was buried with my grandpa.  They used the cash I worked for (we're gonna talk about my job in a minute)  on themselves. It's been two weeks and I still don't know what's the name of the cementery he was buried.

I was a waiter, that also worked as cashier, that also worked as cleaner, that also worked as deliveryman and on top of that I was a translator between the boss and the kitchen. I was under a lot of stress and panic attacks were usual. The waiters know what's up. 

The thing is that I got fired in a week. I nearly made 80 dollars. I sent like 20 dollars for the funeral and I can swear that none of that money was used on him. The rest I used it to buy rum and help with the electricity bill. 

I feel like shit, especially because I risked a lot, risked my ass arriving at dangerous hours to get home, sleep and then go back to work and got some nice panic attacks for that job to be used for hair dye and nails. I consider myself someone positive but it's hard to see the good here.

I've never felt so loveless, so abandoned, lonely, desperate, needy and angry in my whole life. I can't even spend time doing stuff outside because has beem raining for two weeks straight and it seems it's gonna be like that for a long time. I can't go on my bike because of that, and the bike helped me so much

I just want to be truly loved... my mom and dad are aware of this monstrosity, my mom is on my side. My dad not so much, maybe he's not done processing this or something. My brother is far away, and I only have family friends that are like family, but still feels disconnected. 

I can't see how this is good, or how it can get better. And religion is a good joke to me, Jesus wouldn't even know what to do neither. I don't have that ability to feel loved just because someone told them to do so.

 I've been hurt for a while now that I've become a shell, a rock. Incapable of crying. Just expressing myself through words...

That's, and I'm not kidding, about 90% of what we talk about.  Is just her ex, or one of the boys she's talking to, or just about her dating life in general.  I don't talk about myself too terribly often and every time I have, it's literal interruption mid sentence to change the subject.  I know I'm bad at talking, and I'm boring and can't form sentences great, but I thought we were friends?  It's hard for me to blame her but it hurts a lot.

1,"First off, I'm sorry if this page isn't the place for this. I've joined the site sort of just to ask this, and I don't know where to go. If there's another community I should go to, I'll post there.

I'll explain my situation. My mother and I are poor, and we always have been. I won't deny that a large part of this is due to the economy being in fucking shambles, but at least part of our poverty is due to my mom's various addictions. She's mostly sorted herself out now, but I spent much of my youth exposed to her drug habits. She still smokes both cigarettes and weed, and while I can sympathize, my frustration with the fact that this contributes to our financial situation is overwhelming.

Despite how poor we are, my mother absolutely insists on constantly moving and changing jobs. Over the course of my life, we have lived in over 20 different apartments, and made 4 moves that were more than 100 miles in length. Because of this, all of my friends are online. They've been a pillar for me in the lockdown, and helped keep me sane as my life rapidly went downhill.

In short, my mother has begun to use my name and identity in order to make more money for us, all while I've been neglected and parentified for upwards of 6 years. I've considered suicide multiple times. The situation I am in is severely unstable and staying here poses a very significant risk. I honestly can't put into words how awful it has been.

One of my online friends, who lives most of the way across the country, has offered to let me stay with her and her husband for a month and help me establish myself as an adult near where they live. I completely trust them, but I doubt my own ability to get things sorted out. Another one of my friends has offered to buy me a one-way plane ticket. 

I know I need to do a handful of things (get my driver's license, disconnect my bank account from my mother's, sort out my resume and try to secure a job), but I'm afraid I'm missing things.

I lost 3 grandparents this year, (not due to covid), struggled really hard in university and overall just feel so lonely and my drained. I feel like I can’t think straight anymore and seeing my letter grades from school just absolutely crushed me. On top of that, I didn’t even get a high school graduation, just a random 20 minute video :(

I just feel so pathetic and lonely, I’ve never really had issues with school at all before, but online uni has been the most challenging and difficult thing for me, I feel like I can’t remember anything that was ever taught and during exams I get so nervous and panic and make super dumb mistakes. 

My sleep schedule is absolutely ruined, I struggle really hard going to sleep and during the school year would end up going to sleep at around 4-5am and would wake up for 8am online classes, which really affected my performance and understanding of what should have been easy topics. 

I’m so mad at myself for that because I really could’ve done a lot better if I actually got proper sleep, and I’m just so disappointed in myself and my overall performance in school. Thankfully I didn’t fail any classes though. 

Now during the break I’m just in bed all day, then I just sit around at my pc, try to play some video games but I don’t really find anything fun anymore.

After that i did have hook ups with some girls but its not the same thing they are like drugs make me happy and forget about my ex for a brief period of time and then all of a sudden i start think about my ex and im back to square 1.

The trauma that i have is so big that i cant like anyone im rather being single than being with someone Im very afraid of doing always the right thing on the relationship and despite that the person leaves me.                                                                            

It's very stupid crying because of this but i did not have the best childhood(disfuncional famíliy,abuse and bullying at school,loneliness etc.) i need like water those things like hook up with girls,chilling with my friends,going to parties/raves(fuck you covid for taking away that),having good grades etc. to fill the void that i have inside me.            

Since i did go to university i became i much better person but its not good enough i have those moments that i feel im failing to be the best version of myself if i was a even better person my ex would still be with me,finish my course in 2021 instead of 2022(and my father is paying for my studies i simply cannot fail) and sometimes i feel that Im a burden to my friends.

1,"So I have been suicidal a few times in my life. Only once that was pretty bad, and that was a long time ago. 

I have limited relationship experience as I've been with the same person (on and off) for about 17 years. That's a while. But any time those thoughts start sneaking in it's because he becomes abusive and it finally starts to get to me. 

I guess feeling like life isn't worth living because of the way someone treats you (he's a narcissist who has no idea he's a narcissist and who devalues me as often as he can... he figures out what might trigger me and then goes full-force any chance he gets. He has a horrible self-esteem but won't admit it, maybe even to himself, I'm not sure because he never talks about how he feels) is a red flag.

So, I'm wondering. People who have endured narcissistic abuse, and/or been in an abusive relationship, did the depression ease up once you got out of it?

My guess is mine would. I've read a bit about situational depression. These are the things my partner does.:

\- invalidate any of my thoughts or feelings that don't line up with the idea he has of himself of being a perfect guy in every way

\- basically intimidates me any time I am not acting the way that he feels I should be 

\- won't take any form of criticism 

\- criticizes me 

So, basically, devalues me often. Not all the time, but anytime that he feels threatened (which is often) then yah, it's the constant devaluation. I feel like shit. 

I do think that I am currently suffering from SAD but he's awful.

1,"I’m quite young and still live with my parents (mom) an older sister, younger brother, and grandmother. And I think I hate them. There was a point, probably about two years ago now where my little brother was very manipulative. He physically and mentally abused everyone in my home. Before my mom separated from my dad, my dad was the same way, he beat us. Ever since my brother started acting that way, I’ve been different. I remember every time my brother beat me and I told my mom, her response was always “I don’t know what you want from me? I don’t know what to do to make him stop. YOU shouldn’t provoke him, YOU shouldn’t hit him back because then he won’t have a reason to hit you back in return.” She never gave me the chance to explain that he was the one who hit me first for no reason, and I hit back as self-defense. She always made me the problem when it was clearly him. “YOU shouldn’t do this, YOU shouldn’t do that.” All I ever wanted was for her, my sister, and my grandmother to protect me. I did everything I could to protect them but they NEVER did the same for me. He mainly beat me, and they never punished him for it. It was always ME who did something wrong. Since I’m so young I have no where else to go. I have to let them manipulate me, and walk on eggshells when I’m around my brother because I don’t have a choice. Every time something serious happens my family won’t talk about it. I had an abusive father and brother and I was raped and my family never talks about it. Every time I try to talk about my trauma they tell me “it was so long ago why are you not over it by now.” They get angry at me when I’m anything but happy because I’m “ruining their mood.” I’m dealing with all this shit by myself and I have to constantly “be happy” around my family when I’m not fucking happy, otherwise they just hurt my feelings. I used to be super social and I loved meeting new people and dancing and laughing and having fun- but because of these FUCKING PEOPLE I can no longer stand to be around ANYONE! I HATE people! I want to cry every time I’m in a room with even just one person. I don’t want to talk to people, and everything anyone does just pisses me off. These people have completely changed me into an antisocial freak who I can no longer stand. I’m so exhausted and sometimes I want to hurt myself. Sometimes I have. I don’t want to die.

I don't normally make posts like these. I only read others posts and give feedback accordingly, so this is kinda hard for me. Its just that every time I try to think of a future for me, I only kinda see myself in a grave. I've been fighting for so long, trying to keep my demons from getting to me. Even people don't seem to care about my emotions feelings as they do to others. Everyday in my life has always been cold. So cold that sometimes I can't even feel my body. I give everything it takes to make everyone happy but none do the same to me.

Home doesn't even feel like home to me anymore. My parents always say that I have to do as I'm told without hesitation. A small mistake in my household can amount to a month worth of persecution. I've only kept to myself because of this. Everybody's opinions and matters are always given attention and respect all the time. Mine is the total opposite. They say I don't have the right to complain because they do everything to sustain my education my health. I really don't understand how shallow my parents minds are. So they mean to say that I'm only alive because of Education and Food? That's kinda stupid. Heck, I don't even have the right to be angry in my house. Even if I'm out, people constantly judge me for who I am. What do they even know? Nothing. They only see what they want to see.

Hello there I am too confused about how to confess my problems but I need your help I am going through major depression ....just because I don't know if whatever I did was a sinful act or what. I am an Indian girl in my country and what I did was never accepted so I can't even share this with anyone. I am an Indian girl in my country and what I did was never accepted so I can't even share this with anyone.

so 1 year ago... I went to my uncle's house (my father's brother) for my further education. I never wanted to stay with them as my uncles, his wife never liked me but still, I had to stay there, they have their only son who used to be my good friend since childhood.

let me share one important thing we never saw each other as siblings because we never met in the past we used to talk on Instagram si, nice 2015.he had a girlfriend already but still, he used to share some dank memes and some posts which were not appropriate to share with your sister and I was innocent I never knew he liked me as a girl.

so when I started living in his house....he started showing me some efforts that he loves me and proposed to me 5 times cuz we were friends I never knew what he wants but in the end, I thought he loves me so I accepted his proposal and started dating him(it's illegal to date your first cousin in India).but after some times I fell in love with him he asked me to have sex and as we were in the relationship we did it.
and after 8 months of relationship one day, his mom caught us .....and after that day she started making me feel guilty about it and slut-shaming and all she thinks that I am the one who attracted his son by showing my legs and body figure. look whatever I did was wrong or right I won't know but I loved him I still love him but whatever my aunt said about me is killing me every day.....I feel suicidal, slut and disgust is it a sin to love your first cousin?

should I die? I mean my aunt make me feel guilty every time I always get slut shaming.",depression,IS HAVING RELATIONSHIP WITH FIRST COUSIN SIN ? We deserve an punishment,trauma and stress,Relationship

Just wanted to let you know that you have made my year more manageable, made me smile, cry &amp; think - even laugh (shock horror!)

I hate this time of year for many reasons, all of which are serious, some of which are uniquely mine, and most of which, I think we all can relate to.

Found this sub and just wanted to rant and get it off my chest. I just feel so disconnected from everything and everyone. Which isn't really a bad thing because honestly I've always loved isolation. Connecting with people is exhausting and I'm only comfortable being alone. I do love my s/o and love spending time with her. I just mean life in general. I'm the most loving and empathetic person but at the same time, outside of my relationship I don't really have family, friends, etc. That I strongly connect with. It's not the absence of a connection that gets to me, because I don't crave any for the most part. It does however further the ""self hatred"" aspect of things. Like, self expression of what's wrong with me and what not. I feel like another numbing episode is going to start. I haven't been cleaning despite being and OCD freak, haven't been eating right despite health concerns, I don't really want to do anything whatsoever. Conversations are more draining than usual.

1,"I don’t even know where to begin, honestly I’m hoping everything will just kind of work it’s way out without being too long. I’m a father of 4 boys and husband (common-law thanks to life so far) the last almost 6 years have been a consistent battle with being kicked down by life to where I’m running out of ideas on what to do to support my family. When my then girlfriend now spouse first moved in together it was good, and then we were expecting our first born and it was scary/exciting up until the last month where she had an affair, and that’s where the downhill starts. Shortly after we would welcome our son into the world and continue working through what happened. Following this as we started to build our family together while navigating being first parents as well as recovering from adultery I would become unjustly terminated from my job, and then abandoned by my union despite the case being air tight against the company. 

Our troubles really pick up here and I will try to navigate them as point form as possible. We would become reliant on Employment Insurance for the next year and struggle to make ends meet while I looked for work, upon doing this we had a mutual friend who fell on hard times and had him come stay with us. This would result in another affair more extensive affair that would take a long time to work through and navigate. Following this I was able to pick up some contracting work through road construction and start stabilizing financially while working on our relationship. A while after that we became pregnant with our second child that brought a lot of comfort and stability for the duration of the pregnancy and early parts of infancy. Shortly after he was born I landed myself a fairly decent job in another city and we made the move for it. Life here seemed to stable out a little bit with it never going to far ahead but never going to far backwards either but due to the financial stress and burden from previous years it was still quite rocky. 

This would go on for 2.5 years and then 2019 happened. In 2019 our pregnancy with our twins took an unexpected turn that had her emergency airlifted to another province in a major city 8 hours away in the middle of winter. The long story kept short is she became hospitalized for the next 8 weeks until she was in the best optimum time to deliver. During this I had to go on a leave of absence that cut majorly into our finances (we felt we could make it up once it was all said and done) while also finally having a needed surgery completed the afternoon before she was induced. (drove all the way there the next morning as well) Despite complications that almost cost us our youngest twin the hospital was as efficient as possible and although it felt like eternity we welcomed two beautiful babies into the world with one needing a bit more help. Once we were back home I was pending to go back to work once my surgery was healed from. After I had healed I was back to work for a rotation and a half (3 weeks) and then due to a declining market was involuntarily unemployed. 

Back to EI, this time with a significantly more expensive cost of living, babies who require expensive medication, and two older children alongside a larger more costly home etc. This only lasted beginning of June to the absolute end of November but nonetheless was stressful due to having not worked essentially all of 2019. What I thought was a saving grace and a fresh start would become an absolute nightmare. I would be verbally abused by my superintendent whenever alone, ridiculed for factors completely outside of my responsibilities, mocked and belittled when a family emergency arose that called me away, mocked for current financial standing when a vehicle issue arose that prevented me from having the ability to leave work etc. To summarize family emergencies our second child almost died to kick of February 2020 came back to work 24 hours later because we desperately needed $ to get bills back in control and he was stable, proceeded to have my hand fractured and try to work through it to then be mocked for having a breakdown when the shock finally sunk in on almost losing the little man, covid, vehicle repairs/tow from work site, torn ankle muscle from years of injuries finally catching up, our twins developing severe pneumatic bronchitis that could have been fatal... you get the picture (2020 sucked the most)

During the final crisis mention  I was finally lined up for a job in our current city that we had moved for years prior (the bullying gig I had was 2 hours away and I commuted for it every week with no lates/absences) and due to all the circumstance as mentioned I jumped at it, put in my notice and washed my hands. Only to then be ghosted by the company upon my start date and every subsequent day following. I have since had to submit all records of contact to our local branch for investigation as what happened is illegal but this process will take months if I’m lucky. 

So now we are back on EI with essentially no work in the last 2 years with the previous 2.5 years having been spent doing damage control from the last job fall out and I don’t know what to do. EI only lasts for a year, school is almost completely out of the question, my dream job to be an RCMP officer got a ways in but due to a collection having been in our recent history we have to wait for that period to be over and then I can reapply which due to covid even if approved could take years to get to depot. (Collection was a hospital bill that we never received from the twins air lift during the labour [insurance A was supposed to cover but forms never sent out by hospital and B they sent it to the wrong address and never followed up]) Due to covid jobs are scarce to come by.

No matter how hard I try, how disposable I make myself I seem to fail. Every time we finally start to get stable we get shit kicked practically to bankruptcy and it’s been nearly 6 years. I’m half way through my 20’s and I have no idea what to do, at this point I’m considering enlisting because it was always something I strongly considered before I met my wife and maybe it’s an avenue worth exploring. I don’t know if I’m supposed to ask a question at the end and I promise I did my best to keep it shorter as there’s so much that’s happened especially recently but my mental health is at its limit and I don’t know where else to turn other than typing it out. 

Currently I’m searching for work while also doing a creative hobby with the extra free time through Twitch (I was building a brand on YouTube back when I was in between jobs before the move 3 something years ago) and it seems to be helping/gives hope that maybe these digital media’s may also provide some form of stability down the road.

At the end of the day I feel like an utter failure the best of times and I truly understand the desire to just end it all; but I have a duty to my kids, my wife, my family, my friends, and myself to not give up and to just keep trying, it just feels like there’s an emptiness starting to get more of a hold each time.",mentalhealth,Depression gets larger valleys every year,Trauma and Stress ,Financial
1,"This is going to be a long one, but I have no one to talk to, so hoping you don't mind me posting here. 

I (30F) want to start off by saying I've tried to see psychiatrists/psychologists, but I just can't do it. If I don't think they're judging me, I feel like I'm talking irrelevant nonsense and being charged $98/hr for the privilege of having someone listen to it. I'm scared they'll say there's something wrong with me, but I'm terrified they'll say there's nothing wrong and I'm just overreacting/making it up/similar. I hate people, I hate talking to them, working with them, hanging out with them, I even hate being married to one sometimes. I have no friends even vaguely close enough to talk to about this stuff.

My husband (32M) and I have been together 10 years this coming May. In the beginning, it seemed excellent, free, happy, no problems. Then I started full-time work. I went from happy to hang to fatigued, depressed and ready to cry at the drop of a hat. I completed an apprenticeship and a bachelor's degree (at the same time) about 7 years ago now. I used the university time to do my projects, what I wanted, with no one looking over me. 

Things stayed about the same for the last 7 years - I am cranky, fatigued, depressed, etc, but his hugs make me happy and relax me. There were fights and arguments, but what couple doesn't have that? I gave up the self-harm that remains as scars on my hands and elbow. I thought I was doing better, but apparently , I was just getting worse and harder to live with.

I changed jobs 5 years ago, and the problems abated for a while - I am good at what I do, and hate other people interfering and micromanaging, but who doesn't. Now, I have everything I wanted. 

Since we got married 4 years ago, my husband has occasionally threatened divorce if I don't, quote ""stop being a brat"" during arguments. He promised to stop after he realised how much that played into my anxiety, but he really just eased up on using it. 

At the end of Nov, I hurt my hand at work. I won't say how, but I will state that I had 3 weeks off, because I couldn't use my hand while there was an open surgical wound in the palm. I have nerve damage in 2 fingers, but I didn't tell him that, because I didn't want another lecture about me being arrogant and not paying attention to what I was doing. 

Those 3 weeks were the best 3 weeks I have had in a long time. I lost weight, finished 4 projects if been working on for months, we got ahead in our podcast, the house was cleaner than I had ever managed to get it (he usually cleans), and he said to me more than once that he wanted me to stay home all the time, because I was a different person, a better one, and much closer to the girl he fell in love with. 

I went back to work Dec 17. On Dec 23, we had a big argument. What it's about is not important, but he demanded I sit down at the table, and started laying out conditions of divorce. I was to go to my family Christmas and work out how to pay for the house (purchased in June) on my own, because I was to buy him out. That I was disrespectful and entitled and all this other stuff I don't want to repeat, mostly because I stopped listening to the insults when the tone sank in. 

I lost my shit. I started crying, pulling at my hair. I rubbed the palm of my good hand so much and so hard that the blister I left still hasn't healed yet. I pinched the back of that same hand so much it left bruises, blood blisters and I managed to gauge out some skin. Just to stay grounded and feel like I had some control. 

Eventually, he talked himself down (trust me, I was in no state to do it), and came to family Christmas with me, and there was no more of that talk. 

Well, this morning before work, I was in the kitchen having breakfast, trying to gather my strength to go to work. He asked what was wrong. I told him. 2 mins later, he asked what was wrong. I told him again, in a snappier tone. He told me not to snap, it was disrespectful and I should show him more respect than to treat him like that, that I'm just looking for a fight and he wasn't going to give me one. I went to work. A few hours later, I sent him a message when I knew he would be driving, so he could message me when he got to work, no buggy. No answer. I sent another message and asked if he was mad at me, and he sent a tirade that again used the words ""inconsiderate"" and ""disrespectful"", mostly due to me messaging while he's running the store. In response to my query of cider, he said we couldn't afford it with our dwindling savings, but he just spent $100 on weed and another $300 on DVDs in the last 2 days - i was just asking about a $13 pack of cider to share. 

I've reached my point, I'm done. I've spent the last 5 hours at work alternating between trying to figure out how to kill myself without making anyone I know find my body, and googling mental health services in the hope a free one will pop up that I can use to sort myself out. As far as I can tell, you either have to be on a politician salary or the dole to access mental health in Australia; a supermarket worker's wages are just not enough to pay off a home, pay bills, feed us and look after my mental health. Something has to give  and it's going to be me, as soon as I work out what to do with my cats. I've stopped doing the things I love because they make me feel worse because they're things with happier people in them (reading, writing, watching shows). I just want my life stable without all this fucking drama. I don't know how much more of this I can take before I drag a knife down my arm and say goodbye to my kitties. 2021 is the same as 2020 to me, just with different number at the end.

1,"I lost my dad 2 years ago and it absolutely devastated me. But as well as having to deal with that, a lot of other stuff happened around the same time. I left a really toxic marriage and as a result of that moved cities and changed jobs. Some of the people I trusted really betrayed me, it was just an awful time and I went through hell. 

I will never get over losing my dad but I've largely moved on from the rest of it. Overall I'd say I'm in a good place. But when I think about the people who betrayed me and some of the stuff that happened around that time I just feel so angry. I'm trying really hard to make my peace with it all and most of the time I succeed, but sometimes I lie awake at night thinking about some of the stuff that happened and my heart starts racing and I just feel so agitated and angry. 

I can't afford therapy so that's not really an option. I did try a few sessions of grief counselling but it almost felt there was too much to unpack, as it's not just losing my dad but everything else that happened around it. Anyway I couldn't afford to continue.

I know many of my friends suffer with mental health issues as well and may resonate with this as well. I share this because I ,like so many others ,often suffer silently and alone. I may smile and act okay on the outside but really I am falling to pieces. Not many people know that about me because I shut down and don’t let many people in. 

I have been distant from many people I care deeply about because I feel ashamed about how I feel. I feel as though I’m not good enough for them. I sit alone and cry. I don’t want to be social. Very few people are able to force me out of my shell. I mostly stay reclusive. 

After reading this article, I understand more about why I am the way that I am. 

You can read this if you want to understand me better. ⬇️⬇️⬇️

I was with this narcissist for over a year. During this time I found out I was pregnant. We had only been together about 3 months at that point. I didn’t want another baby nor was I ready for one. I was on birth control. This “man” fed me Antibiotics without my knowledge so I would get pregnant. To make matters worse he mentally and emotionally was abusive. Calling me fat (I was 130lbs at my biggest while pregnant) He cheated on me my entire pregnancy (I found out after the fact). 

After I had my daughter, he started getting abusive. I left him. He did everything he could to get me back and naively I fell for it. When my daughter was 5 months old I left again. This time for good. He seemed fine with this. We started working cordially on visitation for our daughter’s sake. I thought everything was fine. When she was 8 months old he asked me to marry him. I respectfully declined but what he did next was awful! He had visitation 10/10/15 and o was to get her back 10/16/15. That was when my nightmare began. 

I was getting ready to go get her and bring her home when I got the phone call that ruined my life. He had kidnapped her! Refused to bring her home and moved 45 minutes away. It took 8 months to find him and 2 more to find a lawyer to help me. I went 10 long agonizing months without any contact from my daughter. 💔 I was broken! Shattered! My son cried out for his baby sister (he was 5). 

When we went to court, his parents paid the lawyers and the judge off so he ended up with primary. I’m still fighting this monster 6 yrs later. 

It’s this nightmare that I relive! 💔

“Similar to PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder) people who have once shared their life with a narcissist may go through corresponding occurrences resembling the symptoms of PTSD. Maybe we should call it PNSD or Post-Narcissist Stress Disorder.

While it is common to have a period of adjusting and coping after a narcissist, for many these periods of difficult adjustments may continue for quite a while. With time, attitude adjustment, letting go of the narcissist and giving the narcissism back to the narcissist (it is THEIR problem and ISSUE, no longer yours) and taking care of you, such traumatic reactions usually get better and dissipate completely.

Anything can bring on PNSD even things as simple as the familiar smell of his/her cologne on a stranger walking by, a song playing on the radio, even certain foods. It doesn’t matter what brings you back to that terrifying nightmare … what does matter is that instantly &amp; out-of-the-blue you are transported back to a time in your life that was mentally and emotionally disturbing. These identifiers are called ‘triggers’.

THREE MAJOR SYMPTOMS OF Post-Narcissist Stress Disorder (PNSD)
1) intrusive memories of the narcissist — these may be memories that had a sudden onset caused by a ‘trigger’, or memories that are continuous and lingering
2) avoidance and emotional numbing
3) anxiety and increased emotional volatility

1) Symptoms of intrusive memories of the narcissist may include: 
1.Flashbacks of their narcissistic rages, images of intense rage or reliving the traumatic event for minutes or even days at a time
2. Suddenly questioning your own mental stability due to months/ years of abuse and/or gaslighting  when trying to perform everyday tasks or relating to others
3. Upsetting dreams about the narcissistic event
4. Difficulty readjusting your self-esteem and feeling good about yourself in social situations resulting from months/years of emotional, mental, verbal and oftentimes physical abuse

2) Symptoms of avoidance and emotional numbing may include:
1. Avoiding social situations, activities, people or relationships that you once enjoyed
2. Trying to avoid thinking or talking about the narcissist
3. Feeling emotionally numb towards life and love
4. Substance abuse or overuse of sleep aids
5. Memory problems
6. Trouble concentrating or performing simple actions
7. Distancing yourself or feeling on the apathetic ‘outside’ of conversations
8. Difficulty starting new relationships or maintaining close relationships
9. Cocooning or hiding
10. Hopelessness about the future or feelings of defeat

3) Symptoms of anxiety and increased emotional volatility may include:
1. Irritability, rage, temper outbursts or anger
2. Being caught up in the gaslighting mode whereas you may have difficulty adjusting to everyday tasks or questioning your memories, motives, and sanity. Self-doubt and loss of self-confidence
3. Overwhelming guilt or shame, self-blame or Stockholm syndrome 
4. Self-destructive behavior, such as casual sex with strangers, drinking too much, not eating properly, quitting your job, or doing drugs
5. Trouble sleeping
6. Panic attacks
7. Crying attacks
8. Being easily startled or frightened, jumpy and hypervigilant
9. Paranoia or imagining worst-case scenarios
10. Questioning others intents and genuinity, especially with new partners
11. Reliving arguments or narcissistic rages in your head”

If you have read this and it resonates with you as well...just know that you are NOT alone! You are NOT worthless and undeserving of love! You ARE beautiful! We are perfectly imperfect and that’s ok! People who truly care about us will be patient! People who truly care will try to understand that we need time and compassion. We don’t have to suffer in silence (even though we still prefer to fake a smile and put on this happy facade) 

DON’T GIVE UP! Have faith (even if you’re not the religious type) that things WILL get better! They can’t hurt you anymore! We are NOT just a victim anymore! We are warriors! We are survivors! 🙏🏻❤️",mentalhealth,Post Narcissist Stress Disorder (PNSD),Trauma and Stress ,Relationship

1,"I apologize if it seems my post doesn’t have much of a point; I’m feeling a lot, but mostly disorganized, lonely, numb, desperate etc.
I’ve recently been gaining more confidence and more of a backbone and I still continue to do so; however, the past two-ish weeks my mood has been going downhill.

I feel like no one in my life is taking it seriously (I have all of like 2 people in my life NOT including my therapist, and granted I don’t really talk about super super deep stuff about myself a bunch) but today has been the second day in a while where I’ve actively thought about suicide and death and dying. 

The feeling of loneliness is overwhelming me recently, being single and realizing I don’t have the second family I used to a couple months back and realizing I don’t have a person who loves me and CHOOSES me out of billions of other humans on this earth. And I’m really really hitting a wall hard, especially since I’m such a hopeless romantic and when I love anyone (romantic or otherwise) I normally love hard.

I’ve asked my therapist to maybe try and see if I can get tested for BPD, at least to ease my mind and she didn’t seem to take that concern seriously either (this was back in early November which was the last time I saw her).
And unfortunately a week or two ago I self harmed again after 9 months clean. And I continue to think about it.

1,"I’ve been living with crippling anxiety for about 5 years now. I’m a 20 y/o male and recently my doctor increased the dosage of my medication due to an increase in panic attacks. I’m not sure if it was the increased dosage, the kind of world we live in, or maybe a bit of both but over the holidays I just kinda lost it. I was in an extremely depressive state; nothing was making me happy and I had no ambition to do anything. The last straw of it was a meeting I had with my boss who told me he was disappointed in my attitude and work ethic and if there wasn’t a change that they’d be looking for something else. I was completely ready to end my life, to put an end to the years of struggling. I had made plans to kill myself later that night, but I didn’t have it in me. I then told as many people as I could, from friends to my closest of family, and as of today I’m beginning my road to recovery. I’m still getting these thoughts once in a while, but it’s reassuring that when things get bad I don’t need to be afraid to tell someone. I’m happy that I’m alive.

1,"Hi sorry I posted something and deleted it but I just can’t cope anymore. I’ve got a year to go still before my adhd referral and we just went into tier 4 (uk) and I don’t what the point is in being here? Anymore? I don’t want to do anything drastic but all this it’ll get better stuff isn’t real bc I’ve been waiting for a while and im still annoying I’m still not smart I still talk about myself all the time and stress 24/7 about people’s opinions of me (which i know are not good bc I’m a drag to be around, even my parents struggle to pretend they like me). 

I had a bit of a breakdown in the car while home and my parents want me to get therapy but I can’t do it by zoom (idk I just can’t process it well) and there’s no one in my life I can talk to. My parents don’t want to deal with it further than that (also if I annoyed my parents with it they genuinely wouldn’t like me and I think that would be the last straw), I barely have any friends and I act like a different person around everyone. I started self harming a bit over last lockdown (my housemates are inviting ppl over and we already got caught and I’m so so anxious about them getting caught and the uni putting me through disciplinary for being in the house) and its all too too much.

Is there anything that could help me right now I have no where to turn. I don’t want anyone to worry about me or have to deal with me dying but I can’t stand being alive anymore. I don’t have much money and I think my gp assumed I wanted drugs from the referral so i have a sinking feeling I’m waiting three years for closure only to be shut down bc my gp wrote me a bad referral and the psychiatrist will just ignore me. If that happens I don’t think I csn carry on and I’m scared.

1,"I'm under quite a bit of stress lately with work and university and it's been taking a bit of a toll. I've already called up my work counselling service and said I'd think about the options they have and I plan to call back after new years. 

But it seems that my mum and brother just won't let up. My brother worries excessively and now whenever he talks to me it feels like everything he says regarding my work is lased with pity. 

And my mum is, as usual, making her own guesses and practically psychoanalysing me. She just seems to justify how I feel then presents me with a solution. Or, if not that, she's insisting I call the councillor sooner than I want and talking about how much her worrying about me is affecting her health. 

I just want to be left to sort this out. I don't want anyone to pity me or present me with solutions who isn't qualified or be excessively pushy. I want to do it on my time and I want to do it in a way that doesn't disrupt my life too much. I don't want to fall behind on my work or assignments just because of some stress. it'll just prolong everything past where it needs to be.

1,"I (20F) haven’t had anxiety before, but all the anxiety I have right now is related to my relationship with my boyfriend (23M). We’ve had many issues, and a lot of these things trigger me at random and my anxiety skyrockets. It prevents me from moving on and working on myself individually and getting better as a couple. I spent all year losing weight and getting fit finally, a dream I had for years. I finally looked good, felt good and was fit. Physically very fit and happy. But this anxiety happened, and now I’m a couch potato. I don’t work out anymore. I just ate like four meals worth of things in one sitting, including a bunch of disgusting McDonald sandwiches. I feel so gross. I’m just eating and gaining so much weight again, and I’m falling back into the person I hated. 

How do I work on this? What are some mental or small strategies that worked for some of you? The dumbest things even.

1,"I feel my youth rushing past me. I keep thinking how many opportunities I've missed out on. I have no close friends and my semester abroad is gone.

I see no end in sight and I feel like there is no point in existing if somehow this is life forever. 

I get up at 10am, which is so unlike me of a year ago. I Google for an hour or 2 about whatever relationship problem I'm having or whatever type of cancer I'm convinced I have this week. I put on a fake smile when my parents come home for lunch and I pretend I've been doing college work and not freaking out over whatever is bothering me today. Then do some half assed college work for a hour or 2 (I used to be a perfectionist) because my heart isn't in it.

1,"Right. I need to write this and it's not because of me, but because of you. All of the people who are going through tough times, no matter the odds. Here i've seen teenagers asking for the purpose of their own lives, why should they keep on going ...and not only the young ones, as much as grown men and women, with their lives fully in their responsibility.

Most people would say that our destiny is in our own hands. Well sometimes life isn't truly in our hands.. sometimes we don't have a say in what is to come and the only free will that we have is in how we react to the events that surround us and the experience we gain from these events.  
So here it goes, not to whine, but to share. Sometimes life throws us into extremes and we have to cope with that. As much as we can.

I was born in a small, shitty eastern-European country, filled with history and hatred. My mother was and still is a hardcore alcoholic, from which i have suffered from my birth to this very day - i was operated from severe gall bladder infection at the age of 3. Barely survived the intervention. My young, mutilated body and mind weren't aware of what's going on for many years and medical operations after, the only thing keeping me alive was modern medicine and educated doctors. (I will always be grateful to them.)

All the way to my late teens i had no idea how sick my body was, cause i had no real parents - my father has abandoned his child for the sake of his great business plans, which always failed, while my grandparents are all dead for decades, except for one grandmother who i never wanted to bother.  
So i did play with the other children, i did go to school, i did all the things that are supposed to be done by children. But all i remember is pain. Pain in my stomach, pain in my soul for not having a decent parent around. I lived through it, i finished high school and i went about the world like an untied horse (as the saying goes..)

i pursued my dreams of becoming a snowboarding instructor, in the same time i came close to horses and teaching people how to ride, i finished courses and have certificates on both fronts. Picked up the guitar, learned how to play a few tunes and how to grab attention, i even had a band and we made records.

It wasn't enough for 'life' and the Universal plan.. the first moment in my life that i had some kind of plan and purpose - i was in love with this very special person, she was everything that i can imagine of being the perfect woman in this world. She was kind, talented, beautiful, full of spirit and adventure, full of utopian ideals of humankind and energy to give out to the world.......

She died in the age of 21, while i was going to be 25. We were supposed to have my birthday together, but instead, she died.. she was buried on my birthday. To this day i have no idea what kind of sick joke of the universe is this, but since then i can't have a birthday.. or whatever of a celebration i have is way too pagan and filled with the Dead. Maybe it's the way it is supposed to be - me to be a host of dead people to have a party... i don't mind and i love them still, but sometimes it gets a bit grim.  


In the first months of her death, there was nothing for me but darkness and dread. I couldn't eat, water tasted like acid, people's voices were so far away.. the only thing i had was weed, alcohol and darkness. No one mattered to me anymore, no single soul could get me out of that pit. Couldn't hear music, couldn't see images in movies or series.. only very strong and dark literature from medieval and ancient times could get through to me.. as i saw people who went through ever darker things than me.  


The bad did not end there.  


She wasn't the only one to go away... as i was free from my 'parents' supervision from a young age - i had the freedom to travel and meet so many people, party, go to concerts of amazing live performances, make real friends... it was always an honor. I met amazing and beautiful, kind-hearted people... some of who died. From cancer, from illness, from car accidents.. now in my facebook i made a secret group of the dead.. they are not few.  


Losing the love of my life.. losing friends who were mentors.. losing friends, who i know i didn't have enough time to spend with... it is a burden. It feels like you need to live for the people who you lost.. but the energy and motivation is just not enough. How can a single person do all that has been left upon him by so many way too early departed?  


So in the meantime, while i was trying to coup with all the terrible things happening and trying to get my life and mind together - my father thought that i hadn't had enough of life lessons so he threw one more just for the fun... he made an official contract under my name (i signed but he didn't tell what) with my country in the baseline that i was working ...but when i understood what was going on it was already too late - the failed contract caused me thousands of Euro dept under my name and now i can't work or live normally in my own home country. Every cent that i get is sent to the government, cause of this.  


And all of that was before the virus crisis. I survived my own lockdowns over the past years. I know there is nothing more that the world can do to hurt me.  


I've seen the darkness from within. I know the worst pains there are in this world - to lose your love, while you still breathe, to lose your child that was the only future of your blood, to lose a parent before you were ready, to lose a true friend that you had not spoken to from the heart...  


There is no pain that can't be overcome. There is no trauma that can't heal. All you need to know is that there is more to life. There is more to give. Even if it is for a moment, even if it to change for the better the life of one person. Every last drop of blood, every last drop of momentum, energy and charge - you need to give. Not to take. Taking your own life is taking... taking opportunities to help, taking time that is not yours to give. It rightfully to the people around you, people who have been next to you, even if not understanding, people who you may never know, but still charge with the energy that you emanate. 

We have no right to take that away. No matter what we go through, even on the contrary - the more we go through - the more we need to share and help the people who are lost.  


Pick up your burden and carry it with pride. Shine through it. Build more. Build better. Build yourself and slash the thorns. Show the world what you are and what you can, no matter the scars. Show that being Human is much more than we even care to dream.",mentalhealth,"The heavy burden of depression, self hatred and absolute damnation. - My point of view and personal experience.",Trauma and Stress ,Relationship
1,"Has anyone ever done it, and how did you approach it with HR?

I have been considering doing it for the past few months, primarily because I feel the job I have been at since COVID-19 has changed me dramatically where I do not feel like the same guy I was in January or February.

Not to mention, I am making hardly any money (US $12/hr) and I am surrounded with a bunch of kids who kind of pick on me and harass me. The managers too have been difficult too. Treating me like I am a child and not a 20-something year old man with a fucking BA.

I was also outed by a manager regarding my Spectrum Disorder, something that I am VERY private about. He confronted me about it, and I was shocked. I told another manager who knew, and he talked to the other manager who played dumb about it, “I didn’t know he was private about it” I believe was his response according to this other manager.

Maybe I just need some time off, I have never put in a day off from this job except to cover personal matters, and I have gone in a lot to cover shifts because of the poor pay.

1,"(Might be unreadable bc I’ll be crying through this)

(( my room is next to my brothers room, and his room is next to my parent’s room ))



I come out of my room because my mum is telling me we have to take our dog on a walk. I go to my parents room but as I walk past I look in my brothers door and he’s crying. I’m very confused as my mum is in her room and can definitely hear him. 

I walk in and comfort him, I give him hugs and tell him it’s going to be alright ( this was extremely uncomfortable for me as he physically abused me for some time in my earlier childhood- I’m 13 and he’s 10 but I pushed through so already I wasn’t in the best mindset having had physical contact with him ) 

He’s crying and tells me that our mum shouted at him and that it made him lose his things in his game ( he flinched because she was shouting and misclicked, that stuff took him a week to get ) I didn’t think that was like her but I believed him as he was crying and then she comes in, shouting that Connor needs to get dressed because we are going on a dog walk. I can’t really remember what happened next but I next remember getting dressed and going down stairs to put my coat on. 

My brother had yet to come downstairs and my mum was getting angry. ( she’s not usually an angry person ) She started shouting at him to come downstairs. Then, we heard my brother crying.it was really loud and it broke me and I started to panic as she started shouting louder and louder, getting my dad ( who’s a fucking cheating lying abusing alcoholic fat ugly stupid cocky gross fucking cunt who should’ve been thrown out years ago ) to start shouting too. 

Obviously my brothers crying got louder and he wasn’t going to get dressed any time soon. I can only imagine how he felt as I was tearing up at this point. My mum eventually stormed holy fuck I can’t stop fucking crying my mum eventually stormed upstairs to my brothers room and started shouting ( she was telling me that he was fake crying but I don’t think he was ) at him “ WHAT THE FUCK GET DRESSED YOU FUCKING IDIOT OMG “ and ( I was still donwstairs ) shouted up “ HOLY SHIT PLEASE STOP SHOUTING “ I was at the end of my rope I was panicking and my brother was crying and I was gonna cry and I just wanted to kill my self and then she came downstairs. 

She looks at me and said “ I thought you wanted more consequences “ ( I had asked her to stop just letting things slide or joking about stuff my brother had done to me because at the time I said it, he was beginning to get verbally abusive ) and I said “ I said I wanted consequences not for you to shout at him because that was just plain mean” she said “ get out. “ and I did and then my brother cane down and we left. 

Once we were outside she said “ haha, well I’ve successfully managed to make both the kids cry today! “ my tears are burning my eyes hold on which I found really rude and insensitive because we are her kids 

She kept making jokes about it to my dad and eventually apologised to my brother

As we were half way through our dog walk, she comes up to us and said “ are you guys talking about how I just traumatised you both haha “ heads up I’m gonna go on a tangent 
That’s just fucking mean to joke about that especially when I’ve told her that I have trauma from her pig of a husband and her son and that trauma is obviously a touchy subject and originally I though she was making a joke about how I confided in her what my dad and brother had done to me but I texted her and apparently it was a joke about how she doesn’t snap that often so if you know what I don’t really understand the joke but apparently it was funny to her but it’s not like I have no reason to believe that she was making a joke about that because she’s done it before about my tics and she makes me feel bad about my derealisation also “ because I don’t snap that often “ but it’s been getting more and more frequent and she’s becoming more like my dad which is fucking horrifying 

It’s so hard to watch her be mean to me and my brother because she’s the only one in my immediate family who hasn’t given me trauma and she’s my rock but she always makes excuses for my dad and brother and I just can’t take this shit anymore 

I don’t understand her because she can just flip her emotions so easily one second it’s YOU FUCKING IDIOT HOLY SHIT and the next it’s aw hey sweetie :) like make up your mind it really feels like this all started because I came out as nonbinary..",mentalhealth,I’ve had a great morning :),Trauma and Stress ,Relationship
1,"Find Self Peace. In yourself. 

I do understand how important it is to have loving, supportive friends, family, partners, relationships etc., but the fact is, YOU are the only person that wakes up in YOUR body and YOU are the only person that goes to sleep. 

These past 9 months of quarantine have been interesting, with lots of time for self awareness, solitude, to sit in myself and be with myself. I have learned a lot, I still struggle. I am healing &amp; I still hurt. I am getting comfortable with my identity, I still struggle with dysphoria. It is all apart of the life of being. The life that yes must have its downs, to know what the ups are. To know that the downs only last for a little while and then there we are, bouncing back up again. It takes time.

Sometimes I feel too secluded and wanting to chat with someone I used to talk to, or someone that has been removed from my life by God and the Universe that I want to check up on just because I feel lonely. We must be present with ourself in those moments and realize that **WE MUST NOT MOVE BACKWARDS BECAUSE WE ARE FEELING LONELY.** There are 1000's of people on the internet to chat with if needed, but realistically in those moments it might be best not to message anyone at all and just sit. 

I love speaking with people, I love conversing, I love communicating and experiencing different perspectives with like minded beings in other places in the world, but as well as I love my space and time for me; to paint, to journal, to meditate, to be outside, to play video games or just solely to sit.

Find whats right for you and focus on that. Connect with people that have unconditional love for you, if you are looking for people like that, go look, they are there and here. All around. I wish you a day of health, happiness and healing. **Together, Separately.**

I love you.

Anyway, I have quite a few good things in my life, including good friends and a loving family, but if you ask me what dreams truly get me up in the morning with the will to live, there are two (albeit corny) answers: pursuing a career in writing, and the idea of falling in love with the girl of my dreams.

In High School I decided I was going to make at least one of those two dreams come true, so I earned a writing degree and started posting my work online.  It was...marginally successful.  In the years since I graduated I've averaged a little under $10,000 a year between my own projects and freelance projects.  Then the pandemic hit, and my income completely fizzled out.  Now I haven't been hired since June and am living with my parents to make ends meet.  I was already getting fatigued marching forward on so little income, now I'm wondering what the heck will even be left after this whole pandemic subsides.  I made the decision a month ago to start applying for a regular old 9-5 job, but it feels like it's crushing me.  It's not that I dislike the jobs I'm applying for, it's just that this dream has been the one thing giving me purpose, the thing I've worked 80 hours a week for and poured my soul into, and it's hard to imagine relegating it to a side project I may or may not have time or energy for anymore depending on what day job I land.

Unfortunately, the love side has been even less successful.  Dating with social anxiety is hard, dating while gay with social anxiety is harder, dating while gay with social anxiety while also trying to explain that you're not financially stable right now is even harder than that.  Needless to say I still haven't found that dream girl and probably won't for a while.

I know my dreams are a bit childish, and I feel guilty that having a loving family and the essentials of life don't feel like enough, but the reality is I feel like I'm barely functioning right now.  I'm trying to move forward imagining a new life that may not have either of those things I wanted.

1,My mom has copd and lung problems. She had a heart attack once and didn’t even know it. She has high blood pressure and breathing problems. Yet she smokes. That doesn’t help. I don’t wanna make her feel bad or judge her. Smoking is an addiction. She is the best person I know. I’ve never really had any friends. I’m lonely. I love my family. I love my siblings so much and I’m really close to them. But it’s not the same. My dad is strange. He acts crazy and switches personality all the time. He was an alcoholic and has physically fought my mom multiple times. (Even when she was pregnant). He’s been to jail for it and doesn’t physically hurt as much anymore. He still has a few times though. He says horrible things to her and I hate him for it. I feel like he hates me more that my other siblings. Me and my brother. I don’t know why but he always chooses us to cuss and loves the others more. He made fun of my brother for painting his nails. He calls him horrible names and used to say that he wasn’t his son. (He is). My brother is only 12 and has the biggest heart. He deserves better than that. He’s said that I wasn’t his too and sometimes I wish I wasn’t. He says I’m lazy and stupid. I cut my hair before and he made fun of me and told me I look like a dy*ke. (Nothing wrong with being lesbian but he was being a homophobic ass). My mom always makes me feel better and it sounds lame but she’s truly my best friend. I love her more than myself and I couldn’t live without her. She’s my everything. I can’t imagine the day something happens to her. I’ve even thought about killing myself before anything happens to her just so I don’t have to see her like that. But I don’t want to hurt her. That would tear her apart and she’s lost so much. She deserves better than that. I don’t want to do that to my brother and sisters or even to my dogs. They don’t deserve that.

1,"In late October, I overdosed to try and ""get away"" from my abusive ex-fiancee and spent almost 2 weeks in the hospital/psych ward. When I got out, it was touch and go for a while as I was readjusting back to normal life. But with the help of my ex-fiancee, I made it through it and have no problem talking about what I remember happening.

Now comes the ex-fiancee part.

I had lived with her since early september, up until she beat the shit out of me in november. 

She had decided to get drunk as hell and use me as her personal punching bag (literally) for the 2nd time in our relationship. And yes, I know it was stupid of me to continue on with her after the 1st time, but I just give the wrong people the most chances apparently.

That night/morning, my buddy picked me up and brought me to his house for the night. Next morning, I gathered up what she hadn't destroyed and left.

2 days later, filed for a restraining order, and after a lot of BS and continuances on her part, I finally got it. 

I thought I was doing ok, and I was healing. NOPE. Shit just keeps getting worse

Yesterday I learned that I was expendable before I was even gone..

The day *AFTER* my and my ex's court hearing, she'd already gotten into another relationship.. with someone she's known longer than me..

I'd seen his name show up on her phone a bit, but never thought anything of it..

So not only was I physically/mentally abused, I was most likely cheated on for the entirety of the relationship..

I don't get why it's affecting me so badly, probably just because I have that constant lingering thought of, ""what is so wrong with me, that I got that sort of treatment?""

1,"When I was little, my parents always said things like “you need to fix yourself” and “If you don’t start *blank* I won’t love you anymore” and have threatened to send me back to my “real” parents (they used to lie about me being adopted). When I was the new kid at an elementary school and tried to make friends with a kid who looked  lonely, she was immediately aggressive towards me and soon said something along the lines of “No one will ever want to be your friend or like you. You’re gross, ugly, and stupid.” When I was in middle school and actually managed to get some friends, and introduced some of them to each other, they started to hang out with me way less. I remember in 6th grade I went up to a friend because he promised to work on a group project with me and he told me “go away and work on it yourself.” I got upset at him and all he told me in response was, “You know what, I don’t even want to be your friend anymore.” I cried during lunchtime and he had the audacity to get a lunch lady to tell me to “stop crying because it was making him uncomfortable.” Speaking of group projects, they have always been among the worst experiences for me. I got called too stupid for drawing poorly in middle school and I forgot how to do something in science and someone said “wow you’re not as smart as I thought you would be.” Group projects became hell in high school. No one wanted to be in the same group with me for one project, so I had no choice but to not only work 4 times as much (it was a 4-5 people group project) but also present to the class for four times as long while trying to overcome anxiety and the terrible speech impediment I had. I got a C(+?) mainly because of “my constant stuttering, trouble focusing, and working alone,” according to the teacher. In another project, I was literally locked out of accessing the presentation online because a group member felt “I was getting in the way” even after I helped bring information and organized it; they kept my contributions in tact, I guess they just didn’t want me to be there because they disliked me. There’s also the time when I literally just asked a question to my group (a different group that is unrelated to the last one) and the leader straight up told me, “Everyone here agrees and understands except you. If you can’t be on the same page, then maybe you should just leave the group” even though I had tried my best to be helpful. I’d go on longer, and talk more about events that are unrelated to school, but this post has gotten too long already.

I wish I had someone that knew me and cared for me as much as I care and know them. I’ve made it this far in life thinking to myself, hiding, alone but it feels like a need. Like I need somebody to love. I wish I had someone to share my vulnerabilities with, without them having a negative view of me or using them to hurt me.

1,"I don’t want to say the actual word for this due to trauma, but I’m sure you can guess what I’m talking about in my childish language. 

I’m trying not to have an addiction, but I notice I do have this great urge to turn to these actions when I feel the most depressed and unloved. And it’s hard to convince myself not to at times. Why not? Don’t you want to feel so much love? Of course I want to feel so much love. There’s not an equal level argument to counteract that is there.. 

I don’t look at porn, due to the fact that I want as real as a connection as possible. So I’ll make up one in my head, and I’ll respond.

I don't feel I'm really awkward at all, maybe I'm too picky, maybe its covid(or thats the excuse I've using). Im just tired of being alone. Watching two of my best friends get married this past year was great but gave me an overwhelming sense of loneliness. I thought maybe I was just horny so I hooked up with someone recently. She wasn't ugly or anything, the sex was good, but I felt absolutely nothing. I don't really know what I'm supposed to do and my future seems bleak especially the way employment is being affected currently.

I am 28 M living in Canada . It has been a difficult time of the year . I had depression at times but not this bad. I always had a way to work around my depression , sadness , loneliness with exercise or physical activities like Kayaking , biking, skiing or new things that interests me . With the winter creeping in and covid restrictions there is hardly anything to do . I feel dragged deeper into the abyss of loneliness. All my friends moved to different provinces for job , I am stuck in the government town cuz I got my career started there. I hangout with few fake friends sometimes but they would do anything for a women not a guy. I always had difficulties making female friends , as they are not direct as guys and some think every guy wants to sleep with them. In addition to all this I am an immigrant , I am stuck between subtle racism from Canadians and isolation from people who come from the land as me. I feel like I belong nowhere. I cant find my tribe.

1,"Needed to vent and seek a bit of advice I don't know of it belongs here. Please delete if it doesn't. I just had to talk to someone about this. I am  27 F pansexual. I have been with guys and I have been with girls. There have been some decent people and there have been absolute fucks. In this year from hell I was doing fine, there have been one or two casual relationships. But I was very content with myself. This is the year I decided to not get into an arrange marriage (it's common in where I live) and made up my mind that I don't want kids. Between cooking, learning new things and gazillion video calls like everyone else I was fine. Then came a boy.

I had known him for a while and then a work trip changed everything. I was attracted to him to the point of felt like I was a teenager again. There was something about him that felt simple. He was a simplistic guy who shared the same vission about life. He was kind, down to earth  street smart, smart enough to know his way around. He was a good friend, kinda meme buddy, we could laugh at each other's poor jooks like litte kids. I felt more authentic around him. He always texting me first when we were just friends. We spoke about our endgoals in life and we have lots of things in common (eg... Not wanting kids). After a long time I felt something genuine for someone and I completely fell for him.

There were multiple instances when it seemed like he might have felt the same way. So after flirting and seeing how things go for two months I finally told him how I felt. He was taken by surprise and told me that he hadn't seen me in that way. But he wanted to give this a shot. Told me wants to take some time. I was over the moon initially. But things changed drastically. He became extremely cold. He wouldn't text first. Stopped sending memes. Would give generic replies when I tried to make convo. It went to become from this to one word replies to single letter at one point. This time around I asked him if he's not into it, should just spit it out. I am not in for this half assed thing. Will be fine just being friends. He again assured that he wants to meet and give this a shot. However while I asked him out a few times in the past one month his answer was always something ambiguous as ""let's see"". When I pointed out that he's been terrible at communicating he told it's how he is (he's not, we used to text all day as friends) and he's sorry that I felt bad (what even). Nothing changed. At that point I knew it was never going to go anywhere.

Since then I have been treating him with the aloofness he has been showing me for the past one month. He's been replying to my texts taking the exact amount of time I took to reply. If it's 10 mins from me, same from him. I am really tired of all these. I guess he wouldn't make up his mind and say no. I could really use a rejection right now. Just tell me that you're not into me and I will be done. If he had done it in the first place I wouldn't have minded at all. I valued our friendship more than anything. But now it's been annoying and I feel like played on. I lost my friend in the process.

Someone gave me a really good relationship advice that don't go for the nice guy and look for the actual good guys. Know the distinction between the two. I want to learn from the past and meet someone good in 2021.Less drama a simple relationship for a change. My friend's advice came as an eye opener. Maybe he's been a nice guy and not a good guy. Maybe I was projecting my idea of him. All these have me questioning everything. Maybe what I thought was genuine humbleness maybe it was just tactical workplace politeness. Because when the power structure changed, as I confessed he went from nice guy to not so nice guy.

Next year I want to make better choices and not jump into anything. I hope to learn the difference between nice guys and good guys and someday I find someone who would give me their time and cherish my company.

Right now after a long time I am aware of my loneliness and it's a not a great feeling. All of my friends are in relationships and some of them have even started to move in together. Visiting my friends this time I was painfully aware that I am the third wheel and my life's gonna be pretty lonely. I hope I will find my rhythm back and not descend into depression.

I guess I made this post because I had to get this off my chest. I felt very stupid for a while, blamed myself fr catching feelings and in for not listening to my closest friends about not confessing my feelings to this guy. I felt very strange at points because there were times when I was depressed and he offered to be there for me. Telling me that it's ok to talk to him about these things. And then the same guy turning cold and simply replying ""there there"" when I tried opening up to him this time around. Something did not add up. This guy who would talk about our favourite movies and stuff till 2am and tell me that he can still go on when I would say we should get some sleep, now when I watched a movie he had been asking me to watch for months, his reply was ""O"". A single fucking letter. And I thought I was going crazy catching feelings for this guy while he might have never actually liked me even on the basic level.

I guess I am seeking advice on how to be normal again. Not see this life as a lonely one where I would come back home to an empty apartment after work. Right now life, it feels fucking long and difficult to make through.

1,"I’m a 19-year-old female and I’ve never been in a relationship, but it has never really bothered me until the pandemic occurred and we’ve all been stuck inside all day. Basically, I’m always crushing on someone whether they be a classmate or a celebrity. Every crush I’ve had is with a guy I’ve never spoken to, so I’m only obsessed with the idea of him instead of who he really is. I kind of know I’m still not emotionally ready for a relationship, but I still like to fantasize about being with someone. Recently I’ve been watching this ‘90s sitcom and there was this actor who was around my age at time of filming who I thought was very good-looking. I spent a couple hours googling articles and reading interviews about him, and found out he is more deep than his television character portrays and he enjoys doing the same things I do. Now for the past week all I can do is fantasize about being with him, which is pretty ridiculous considering the fact that he’s in his 40s now and there’s no way I’d even be able to meet him and form a relationship with him. But all I can do is imagine him in his younger days and me being his girlfriend. I don’t know how to break out of this spell. If I had more friends, it wouldn’t even bother me that much that I’m single. However, the only two friends I have are a bit problematic. One of them is toxic and the other is more nice, but our relationship is very surface-level and we can’t connect. Basically you could say I really don’t have any friends.

This year has been the worst. Since i remember myself i have always been a bit sad but i didn’t think anything about it. Last year i changed shools and i had to make new friends. I lost my only friends because of my mental health problems, i started to feel left out and like im not fitting in this group anymore, even we where friends for at least 10 years. To one of the girls i told everything i thought about, how i felt left out and missunderstood.). I said that i didn’t like how she acted and other stuff. After that she called everyone and turned against me. She told them that im not normal. (There where multiple times that we went out and i felt really sad or ignored. When i quietly left they always were super meant to me about that but i just didn’t want to ruin their night.) They always were so fun and everything but since we changed schools they started to act different.  In new school i made few friends but they sometimes make fun of me- they comment negative things on my clothes, they sometimes make negative comments about my looks- like im not pretty and why i would thought that im pretty enought for that boy. I of course ignored that and always tried to be nice to them. Even when they were annoying- i never said anything ,but if i did something wrong, they would make me feel bad about it. As they have a lot bigger following on social media they didn’t include me in photos or posted pics where i looked bad. Every boy likes them but im just like the ugly friend. Im 17 and no one has even once asked me out or anything. I never thought of myself as being ugly but now... im not so sure anymore. I try so hard everyday to look good and im nice to everyone. Since quarantine, nobody has been wanting to talk to me. They only hmu when they need homework or something from me. I want to leave them but i know that they are gonna turn everyone against me. I really don’t have any real friends and i don’t wanna miss out on my teeneger years. I know that when im gonna be older i will be sad that i missed out on those years but i really don’t have anyone.

So they change the subject so they won’t feel uncomfortable anymore, not knowing how crushing it feels to have ones issues shooed off.
